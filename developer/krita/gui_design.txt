Overall GUI design of KImageShop:
---------------------------------

KImageShop will have several windows. Each window is a shell which has
a menubar, several toolbars, a statusbar, and a document view. If the image
that is represented by the view is larger than the visible area there will
appear scollbars on the right side and at the bottom of the view.

The user can open several shells, each containing another image. But it is
also possible to open several shells of one document. Each view will be handled
independent from the other ones. If the image is manipulated all views will be
updated, that shows the document containig this image.


Menubar and Toolbar:
--------------------

The menubar and the toolbars can either be docked into the shell or it can be
loosely located on the desktop.

The menubar can be docked either on the top or the bottom of the shell.

The toolbars con be docked on each side of the shell window. 

Each toolbar contains a couple of buttons with actions that belongs together.
We have extra toolbars for:

- file handling and printing
- selection
- simple drawing
- color selection


Statusbar:
----------

The statusbar will be located at the bottom of the shell window. It will show the
current cursor position on the image and other important data. The statusbar cannot
be docked on another side of the window or loosely located on the desktop.


View:
-----

The view shows the document containing the image. The view can zoom the image for
better viewing, e.g. a 1800x1800 zoomed to 500x500 because the monitor resolution
is 1024x768 and you want to see the whole picture.
