<p>This page describes how to prepare screenshots for the KOffice website.</p>

<h2>Preparation</h2>

<p>To keep a professional and consistent look, it would be better for
the screenshots to be in Plastik style, Plastik window decorations and KDE
default colours.</p>

<p>To set this up, from "System Settings" (which you can find in your
K-menu) and click "Theme Manager", choose "Plastik", and click "Apply".
This should set your window decorations, widget style, and colour scheme to
the KDE defaults.</p>

<p>For more information, see the <a
href="http://i18n.kde.org/doc/screenshots.php">KDE Screenshot
guidelines.</a></p>

<h2>Image sizes</h2>

<p>Remember that people viewing your screenshots may not have large screens,
and will be viewing them in a browser which will take up some screen space for
itself, so try not to make the high resolution images too large.  KDE
applications should work in 800x600, but it can be difficult to make
attractive screenshots at that resolution.</p>
