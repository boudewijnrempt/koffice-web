<p>The following tasks for koffice.org would need some volunteers.</p>

<p>If you send patches for the koffice.org, be careful to use the source in the CVS directory:
www/areas/koffice</p>

<ul>
    <li><del>Some pages are supposed to be XHTML 1.0 but they still contain errors. Such
    pages should be fixed. (Difficulty: **; Sharability: *)</del></li>
    
    <li><del>Check and fix spelling (Difficulty: *; Sharability: *)</del></li>
</ul>

<p>Note: some of the tasks could be done on all KDE Web sites.
Contact <a href="http://www.kde.org/mailinglists/index.php#kde-www">the kde-www mailing list</a> in that case.</p>
