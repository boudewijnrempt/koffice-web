17.05.2008-17:56 < el> hi neha, hi boud
17.05.2008-17:56 < Neha> hi el, hi boud
17.05.2008-17:56 < Neha> How are you doing?
17.05.2008-17:57 < Neha> I am using IRC for the first time, I apologize before hand if I make any mistakes
17.05.2008-17:57 <@boud> evening!
17.05.2008-17:58 <@boud> (at least, for me it is :-)
17.05.2008-17:58 < el> hehe, for me as well
17.05.2008-17:59 <@boud> where are you from, Neha?
17.05.2008-17:59 <@boud> (I'm from the Netherlands)
17.05.2008-17:59 < Neha> I am from India
17.05.2008-17:59 <@boud> cool. we've got quite a few people joining in from india recently
17.05.2008-17:59 < Neha> really, that's great
17.05.2008-18:01 <@boud> girish ramakrishan, roopesh chander and, but he disappeared recently, balachandra chandrachenam (I might be making an orthography error  there)
17.05.2008-18:01 < el> have you ever been to foss.in, neha? it is in bangalore in november, i think
17.05.2008-18:01 < Neha> no i haven't
17.05.2008-18:01 < Neha> I am from New Delhi and Banalore is quite far from my place
17.05.2008-18:02 < Neha> I have never ever been to bangalore
17.05.2008-18:02 <@boud> neither have I :-)
17.05.2008-18:03 < Neha> :-)
17.05.2008-18:03 < el> i haven't either. :) but all the people who attended the conference said it's one of the best they've ever been to
17.05.2008-18:04 <@boud> It looks likely I will have to visit Kerala for an LGM in 2010, though.
17.05.2008-18:04 < Neha> that sounds good
17.05.2008-18:04 < el> wow
17.05.2008-18:04 < Neha> wow! kerela is one of the beautiful places in the world ( i have just seen it in pics)
17.05.2008-18:05 <@boud> I have studied sanskrit, nepali, tibetan and various kinds of Chinese, but I've never been east of Athens
17.05.2008-18:05 < Neha> cool! u know sanskrit. i have studied sanskrit in my 9th grade
17.05.2008-18:06 < el> wow, i didn't know that! have you studied at university or taught yourself?
17.05.2008-18:06 <@boud> it's a long time ago for me, I'm afraid
17.05.2008-18:06 <@boud> for me, it was part of university
17.05.2008-18:07 <@boud> I managed to read bit of the Nala, the Hitopadesa and the Shakuntala play
17.05.2008-18:07 < Neha> great
17.05.2008-18:07 < el> heh, never heard of that but it sounds great
17.05.2008-18:07 < el> what did you study, boud?
17.05.2008-18:08 <@boud> comparative linguistics of the Sino-Tibetan languages
17.05.2008-18:08 <@boud> I actually specialized in languages of the hill regions of Nepal before getting into coding
17.05.2008-18:08 < Neha> :-)
17.05.2008-18:08 < el> hehe, coding is just another language to learn ;-)
17.05.2008-18:08 <@boud> that's what I always tell people
17.05.2008-18:09 <@boud> will celeste join us, too?
17.05.2008-18:09 < el> she intended to, yes
17.05.2008-18:09 < el> maybe we can already start with some organisational things
17.05.2008-18:09 <@boud> ok
17.05.2008-18:09 < Neha> sure
17.05.2008-18:09 < el> i can summarise that and send an email to her later
17.05.2008-18:10 <@boud> Neha: which os/linux distribution do you use?
17.05.2008-18:10 < el> boud, what version of koffice should we use?
17.05.2008-18:10 <@boud> latest alpha would be ok. we didn't do much usability wise since then -- just trying to get it stabilized a bit
17.05.2008-18:11 <@boud> it's available for OpenSUSE at least, and I just heard Saroengels got it built for Windows.
17.05.2008-18:11 < Neha> my computer currently has windows XP
17.05.2008-18:11 <@boud> I'll ask saroengels how hard it is to install koffice for windows atm
17.05.2008-18:11 < el> are there kubuntu packages for it, too?
17.05.2008-18:11 <@boud> otherwise, you might need to install something like virtualbox with an opensuse image. -- running linux in a virtual session.
17.05.2008-18:11 <@boud> I'm not sure
17.05.2008-18:12 < Neha> ok
17.05.2008-18:12 < el> neha, you have some linux experience, right? have you ever installed it?
17.05.2008-18:12 < Neha> i have worked on linux but had never tried installing it
17.05.2008-18:13 < Neha> but i can figure this out..
17.05.2008-18:13 < el> if boud thinks the windows package is good enough, there is no need to install windows
17.05.2008-18:14 < el> and if installing it isn't too much of a problem... 
17.05.2008-18:14 < Neha> yeah
17.05.2008-18:14 <@boud> saroengels says it's easy enough. 
17.05.2008-18:14 < el> cool
17.05.2008-18:14 < Neha> ok..i can try
17.05.2008-18:14 <@boud> there is an installer uploaded about 20 minutes ago for windows that includes it
17.05.2008-18:15 < el> boud, are there any issues regarding the integration with the desktop? e.g. focus issues with the palettes or anything like that?
17.05.2008-18:15 < Neha> thanks for letting me know
17.05.2008-18:15 <@boud> yes, there are focus issues with the palettes
17.05.2008-18:15 <@boud> not sure whether they happen on all platforms
17.05.2008-18:16 <@boud> they are bugging me a lot, sicne I had them solved for the last 1.6 version :-(
17.05.2008-18:16 < el> what platforms are known to have problems?
17.05.2008-18:16 <@boud> Neha: http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/KDE_on_Windows/Installation
17.05.2008-18:16 < Neha> thanks boud
17.05.2008-18:16 <@boud> el: I actually think the focus handling is the same on all platforms, but I haven't seen KOffice run anywhere except on Linux
17.05.2008-18:17 <@boud> all developers except for Marijn Kruisselbrink are on Linux (he's on OS X)
17.05.2008-18:17 <@boud> the windows port is done by the amazing KDE windows team
17.05.2008-18:17 < el> ok
17.05.2008-18:18 < el> i suggest that neha first tries the windows version, celeste and me will compare the windows version to the linux version during next week and see if there are major differences regarding the interaction
17.05.2008-18:18 <@boud> cool
17.05.2008-18:18 < Neha> sure
17.05.2008-18:18 < Neha> i will do this
17.05.2008-18:18 < el> if so, we will need to find another solution for neha. maybe we can ask somebody to create a koffice life cd
17.05.2008-18:18 <@boud> I don't have a windows machine with a recent enough processor or a big enough hard disk partition to try kde on windows :-)
17.05.2008-18:18 < el> i got windows xp in a virtual machine. that should work.
17.05.2008-18:19 <@boud> I'm sure dirk could help us out -- maybe the opensuse kde4 live cd's even include koffice already.
17.05.2008-18:19 < el> ah, cool. so we only need to check if it's the recent alpha version
17.05.2008-18:20 < Neha> i can try working on koffice on windows machine and let you know if I face any issues
17.05.2008-18:20 <@boud> no, the opensuse live cd doesn't include koffice. But we can ask binner about that.
17.05.2008-18:20 <@boud> I think the big usability and interaction design problems will be apparent on every platform
17.05.2008-18:20 < el> neha, yes. first try the windows version. if it is ok, it's the easiest way.
17.05.2008-18:20 < Neha> yeah...
17.05.2008-18:20 < el> boud, ok
17.05.2008-18:21 < el> hm, seems like celeste wouldn't make it today. she is going to fly out to prague later today
17.05.2008-18:21 <@boud> maybe I should first explain a bit about the backgrounds of the koffice2 interaction design?
17.05.2008-18:21 < el> probably she is busy with packing etc
17.05.2008-18:21 < el> yes, boud. please go ahear
17.05.2008-18:21 < el> ahead
17.05.2008-18:21 <@boud> ok
17.05.2008-18:21 <@boud> well, there are three sources of inspiration for the i-a design of KO2:
17.05.2008-18:22 <@boud> * Gobeproductive
17.05.2008-18:22 <@boud> * Apple's office suite
17.05.2008-18:22 <@boud> * the adobe set of apps
17.05.2008-18:22 <@boud> all three allow combining different types of object in a page/sheet based design
17.05.2008-18:22 <@boud> direct manipulation of those objects on the page
17.05.2008-18:22 <@boud> and mixed-content document without actual document embedding
17.05.2008-18:23 <@boud> We decided on having a toolbox (photoshop like) with tools suited to the current task at hand
17.05.2008-18:23 <@boud> and a set of palettes to manipulate the selected object, set the properties for the current tool and some application settings (like current color)
17.05.2008-18:24 <@boud> in L&F, koffice apps right now look most like photoshop, indesign or illustrator
17.05.2008-18:24 <@boud> so, we're combining small, fine-grained content objects in compound document
17.05.2008-18:24 < el> boud, who is the target group for koffice?
17.05.2008-18:24 < Neha> ok..got you
17.05.2008-18:24 <@boud> to our surprise, the toolbox isn't working well. We don't know why it feels wrong, but it doesn't work
17.05.2008-18:25 <@boud> and the distance between the toolbox and the tool option palette is too big
17.05.2008-18:25 < el> hm, ok...
17.05.2008-18:25 < Neha> can i know who is the target audience for this app?
17.05.2008-18:25 <@boud> one minute, I'll come to that
17.05.2008-18:25 <@boud> and tools keep appearing and disappearing. We had a lot of trouble deciding whether tools should create new shapes or shapes should be retrieved from a palette (it's currently the latter)
17.05.2008-18:26 <@boud> we decided to focus on maximizing vertical document space because of the growth of wide-screen screens
17.05.2008-18:26 <@boud> as for target audience
17.05.2008-18:27 <@boud> it's mostly soho/creative: students having to hand in a bling report, grandma producing a family newsletter, an illustrator trying to keep track of assignments, a writer of short stories intending to self-publish through lulu
17.05.2008-18:27 <@boud> we have an uneasy combination of straigh office apps and high-end creative apps, though, which is an historical artefact.
17.05.2008-18:28 < el> so different apps have different target groups
17.05.2008-18:28 <@boud> we're not after the office/secretary/report writing crowd
17.05.2008-18:28 <@boud> yes
17.05.2008-18:28 <@boud> and there are outliers, like kexi and kplato (database and project planning)
17.05.2008-18:29 <@boud> those use the common infrastructure, but are really specialized in function.
17.05.2008-18:29 < el> have you also redesigned them to fit the new interaction paradigm?
17.05.2008-18:29 <@boud> that's another problem
17.05.2008-18:29 <@boud> kexi got redesigned to look like a cheap copy of MS Offce 2007 -- with ribbon.
17.05.2008-18:30 <@boud> kplato hasn't been redesigned much at all, so it doesn't quite fit either
17.05.2008-18:31 < el> i think we should limit the scope, we only got ±3 months for the project
17.05.2008-18:31 <@boud> yes
17.05.2008-18:31 < Neha> i agree
17.05.2008-18:31 <@boud> we need a solution that works for kword/kpresenter/karbon/krita: those are the core applications
17.05.2008-18:32 <@boud> well, even just a pointer to something that will work would be great, it doesn't even have to be a finished solution
17.05.2008-18:32 < el> yeah, sure. but we first need to check if a generic solution can work for all of them
17.05.2008-18:32 < el> boud, when you described the target group, you talked about an illustrator and a grandma
17.05.2008-18:32 <@boud> we've been working on this for two, three years now and we really cannot get any distance or overview anymore.
17.05.2008-18:33 <@boud> yes. people who want to prepare something nice-looking without too much effort. 
17.05.2008-18:33 <@boud> about the same target audience as apple's office suite, I think.
17.05.2008-18:33 < el> ok
17.05.2008-18:34 < el> i haven't really used in design, but to me it seems to be an application that targets designers (professionals). so i think it would be good to fill out one of celeste's user research profiles for kwrite, kpresenter, etc to see if they target the same groups
17.05.2008-18:35 <@boud> ok
17.05.2008-18:35 < Neha> that sounds  a good idea
17.05.2008-18:35 <@boud> is that something we coders should do?
17.05.2008-18:35 < el> neha, have you read about those user research profiles in celeste's blog?
17.05.2008-18:35 < Neha> i am curious to look at this app
17.05.2008-18:35 < Neha> not in celecte's blog
17.05.2008-18:36 < el> boud, i need to talk to celeste how she usually does that. i think she interviews the developers and fills it in herself, but i'm not sure
17.05.2008-18:36 < Neha> but i know about user profiles and have even used them in my class project
17.05.2008-18:36 < el> neha, so maybe that would be a nice first task for you: interview boud and a few other koffice developers to fill the user research profiles
17.05.2008-18:36 < Neha> sure
17.05.2008-18:37 < el> neha, let me search the link to the template...
17.05.2008-18:37 < Neha> thanks el
17.05.2008-18:37 < el> http://techbase.kde.org/index.php?title=Projects/Usability/Project_User_Research_Template
17.05.2008-18:37 < Neha> thanks
17.05.2008-18:38 < el> boud, does koffice have a project space on techbase?
17.05.2008-18:39 <@boud> I don't think so. We've got our own wiki, though
17.05.2008-18:39 < el> ah, cool. is it open or do we need accounts?
17.05.2008-18:39 <@boud> thomas zander (zander@kde.org) can give out accounts.
17.05.2008-18:40 < el> ok, i will ask him for accounts for neha, celeste and me
17.05.2008-18:40 <@boud> great
17.05.2008-18:41 < el> OK, so first step will be to fill user research profiles for each of the applications (kwrite, kpresenter, krita, karbon)
17.05.2008-18:42 < el> neha, krita is the image manipulation software and karbon is spraedsheet
17.05.2008-18:42 < Neha> ok
17.05.2008-18:42 <@boud> no, karbon is the vector app
17.05.2008-18:42 <@boud> kspread is the spreadsheet
17.05.2008-18:42 < el> oh, right, sorry!
17.05.2008-18:42 <@boud> but it's got its own problems:
17.05.2008-18:42 < el> heh, too many k-applicaitons ;-)
17.05.2008-18:42 <@boud> it's pretty much done and works fine, but all developers have disappeared
17.05.2008-18:42 < Neha> yeah :-)
17.05.2008-18:43 < Neha> hmm...
17.05.2008-18:43 <@boud> for 2.1 or 2.2, we'll need to do something about kspread -- it has the potential to become much more flexible and layout-oriented. But for now, it works semi-fine.
17.05.2008-18:43 <@boud> and it's not kwrite, but kword :P
17.05.2008-18:43 < el> eeek! boud, who should neha talk to to fill the profiles?
17.05.2008-18:44 <@boud> krita: me
17.05.2008-18:44 < Neha> ok
17.05.2008-18:44 <@boud> kword: Jan Hambrecht, <jaham@gmx.net>, jaham on irc
17.05.2008-18:44 <@boud> no,
17.05.2008-18:44 <@boud> karbon: Jan Hambrecht, <jaham@gmx.net>, jaham on irc
17.05.2008-18:44 <@boud> I'm getting confused, too!
17.05.2008-18:44 < el> hihi :)
17.05.2008-18:44 <@boud> kword: Thomas Zander, zander@kde.org, tzander on irc
17.05.2008-18:45 < Neha> he he
17.05.2008-18:45 <@boud> kpresenter: Thorsten Zachmann, <t.zachmann@zagge.de>, zagge on irc
17.05.2008-18:45 < Neha> ok
17.05.2008-18:45 < Neha> ok 4 applications..4 developers
17.05.2008-18:45 < Neha> got u
17.05.2008-18:45 <@boud> btw, thomas zander rather fancies himself a usability expert/interaction designer, although he's been hard-core coding for years now.
17.05.2008-18:46 < Neha> el by what time do you want me to be complete with user profiles
17.05.2008-18:46 <@boud> and he's pretty eager to give out advice, asked for or not.
17.05.2008-18:46 < Neha> thanks for letting this know boud
17.05.2008-18:46 < Neha> :-) i will try my best
17.05.2008-18:46 <@boud> so, if he tells you do something this way or that, first contact el or celeste 
17.05.2008-18:46 < Neha> hmm...thanks boud
17.05.2008-18:47 < el> Neha, let's meet again in ±one week and see how far you got. Depends a bit if the developers have time to answer your questions
17.05.2008-18:47 < Neha> that's right too
17.05.2008-18:47 < el> In the meantime, please also try to install KOffice and get familiar with it. 
17.05.2008-18:48 < Neha> i m quite packed this week, with my finals and i am graduating next saturday
17.05.2008-18:48 < Neha> so i m pretty much packed
17.05.2008-18:48 < el> sure, no problem
17.05.2008-18:48 < el> take your time
17.05.2008-18:48 <@boud> btw
17.05.2008-18:48 < Neha> but i will try my best to get this done as much as I can
17.05.2008-18:48 < el> i'm actually on vacation next week.
17.05.2008-18:48 < Neha> yeah..thats my first priority
17.05.2008-18:48 <@boud> I will mostly be available from about 19:00 to 23:00 CET on irc -- but I'm good at answering mail (boud@valdyas.org) very quickly
17.05.2008-18:49 < Neha> thanks boud
17.05.2008-18:49 < el> ok. for me, monday to friday is good between 20.00 and 23.00, thursday and friday i'm available earlier
17.05.2008-18:49 < Neha> my plan is to send questionnaire through e mail to all the developers
17.05.2008-18:50 < el> good. if they haven't replied after a week or so, we can bug them on irc ;-)
17.05.2008-18:50 < Neha> yeah...sounds good
17.05.2008-18:51 < el> When should we meet next? as neha is having exams and I am on vacation - shall we postpone the next meeting to week 26.5.-30.5.? 
17.05.2008-18:51 <@boud> fine with me
17.05.2008-18:51 < Neha> i m fine with this too
17.05.2008-18:51 < el> we can check the answer status in between (end of next week, maybe)
17.05.2008-18:52 <@boud> sure
17.05.2008-18:52 < Neha> sure
17.05.2008-18:52 < el> good. shall we already fix a date or do it by email - so celeste is included?
17.05.2008-18:52 < Neha> anything works for me
17.05.2008-18:52 <@boud> I'd prefer email, myself, if it's just a matter of checking whether everyone replied
17.05.2008-18:52 <@boud> discussing the answers is easier on irc
17.05.2008-18:53 <@boud> btw -- it might be a good idea for Neha to be subscribed to koffice-devel@kde.org
17.05.2008-18:53 < el> yeah, and for me, too, i suppose ;-)
17.05.2008-18:53 <@boud> it's not very high traffic, but it does give a feel for the developer community.
17.05.2008-18:54 <@boud> and we just got a volunteer from China to work our website and she needs to know about target audience, too.
17.05.2008-18:54 < el> do you have the link to the subscription page?
17.05.2008-18:54 <@boud> https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo/koffice-devel
17.05.2008-18:54 < el> thanks
17.05.2008-18:54 < Neha> thanks
17.05.2008-18:55 < el> neha, do you have more questions right now?
17.05.2008-18:56 < Neha> not yet until i see the application myself
17.05.2008-18:56 < el> ok
17.05.2008-18:56 < el> for organisational things: the project should be finished by mid of august
17.05.2008-18:57 < el> mentors will be asked to evaluate the project. if it was finished, you will be paid your stipend afterwards
17.05.2008-18:57 < Neha> question - is it $1000 for the whole project?
17.05.2008-18:58 < el> yes
17.05.2008-18:58 < Neha> ok

17.05.2008-18:58 < el> heya seele!
17.05.2008-18:58 < seele> yikes.. i totally forgot about the meeting.  i didnt set up a reminder
17.05.2008-18:58 < seele> sorry about that
17.05.2008-18:58 < Neha> hi seele
17.05.2008-18:58 < el> hehe, no problem
17.05.2008-18:58 <@boud> hi seele
17.05.2008-18:58 < seele> did you talk already?
17.05.2008-18:59 <@boud> nearly done, in fact :-)
17.05.2008-18:59 < seele> haha.. cool.  i'm sure you have it under control :)
17.05.2008-18:59 < el> yes. we agreed that neha would start by interviewing developers to fil in the user research profiles
17.05.2008-18:59 < seele> ok, that is a great idea
17.05.2008-18:59 < el> boud gave us some email addresses, and once a first draft is there other developers can comment on it
17.05.2008-19:01 < seele> ok sounds good
17.05.2008-19:01 < seele> will we have weekly status meetings or just whenever we need to discuss?
17.05.2008-19:01 < el> i think weekly would be good
17.05.2008-19:01 <@boud> yes
17.05.2008-19:02 < Neha> weekly meeting is more preferable for me
17.05.2008-19:02 < el> but next meeting will be in about 1.5 weeks (between may 26 and 30)
17.05.2008-19:02 < seele> yes
17.05.2008-19:02 < el> we haven't fixed a day yet
17.05.2008-19:02 <@boud> let me nix Tuesday 27 to start with -- I've got an appointment that evening
17.05.2008-19:03 < seele> btw, Neha nice to meet you and welcome to the SoU
17.05.2008-19:03 < Neha> nice to meet you too, thanks
17.05.2008-19:04 < seele> ok, we can probably wait until the end of next week or next weekend to schedule the next meeting
17.05.2008-19:04 < seele> i'm going to be gone for a week from work, so i'm not sure what meetings i'll have set up for that week until then
17.05.2008-19:04 < Neha> ok
17.05.2008-19:06 < el> ok
17.05.2008-19:06  * el is just summarising the meeting in a mail, that's why i am so quiet.. ;-)
17.05.2008-19:06 <@boud> :-)
17.05.2008-19:06 < Neha> :-)
17.05.2008-19:09 < seele> ok, i am going to finish packing
17.05.2008-19:09 < seele> sorry i missed the meeting

04.06.2008-21:07 <@boud> I hope Neha and Ellen haven't forgotten about the meeting
04.06.2008-21:07 < seele> i hope not either.. they both marked this as an available time
04.06.2008-21:07 <@boud> There's lots of interest in the koffice developer team in the sou.

04.06.2008-21:13 < el> hehe

04.06.2008-21:13 < seele> hehe
04.06.2008-21:13 < seele> ok.. so here was the agenda i proposed:
04.06.2008-21:13 < seele> * Questions or comments so far
04.06.2008-21:13 < seele> * Status on KOffice developer interviews
04.06.2008-21:13 < seele> * Status on KOffice User Research Template
04.06.2008-21:13 < NPahwa> uhh...
04.06.2008-21:13 < seele> * Tasks for next week (or next 2 weeks)
04.06.2008-21:13 < seele> anything you want to add or change?
04.06.2008-21:13 < el> i will have to get off in ±10 minutes, then a 10 minute walk to the hiotel and i'll be back
04.06.2008-21:13 <@boud> ok
04.06.2008-21:13 < NPahwa> ok
04.06.2008-21:13 <@boud> shall we start with reviewing things accomplished?
04.06.2008-21:13 < el> has neha managed to install koffice?
04.06.2008-21:14 < NPahwa> i have managed to install i
04.06.2008-21:14 < NPahwa> it
04.06.2008-21:14 < el> cool :)
04.06.2008-21:14 <@boud> and run some apps?
04.06.2008-21:14 < NPahwa> but still have some problems with it
04.06.2008-21:14 <@boud> do tell
04.06.2008-21:15 < NPahwa> i am able to install kofice

04.06.2008-21:16 < seele> yeah
04.06.2008-21:16 < el_> good. sorry
04.06.2008-21:16 < NPahwa> i could find applications such as designer rumming but i cannot open kword
04.06.2008-21:16 < el_> please go ahead when i disappear, i'll catch up by reading the log later if someone sends it
04.06.2008-21:16 <@boud> sure
04.06.2008-21:16 < NPahwa> nor could i open krita
04.06.2008-21:16 <@boud> NPahwa: when I used the kde-windows installer to install koffice I had to copy the dlls from kde4/libs to kde4/bin to make it possible to start apps
04.06.2008-21:17 <@boud> or add kde4/libs to the path in system settings
04.06.2008-21:17 <@boud> (although the windows gurus in #koffice advice against that)

04.06.2008-21:19 < NehaP> i m sorry, looks like there is some problem with my IRC
04.06.2008-21:19 <@boud> ok
04.06.2008-21:19 <@boud> let's try again
04.06.2008-21:19 <@boud> 1:16:58 <@boud> NPahwa: when I used the kde-windows installer to install koffice I had to copy the dlls from kde4/libs to kde4/bin to make it possible to start apps
04.06.2008-21:19 <@boud> 21:17:10 <@boud> or add kde4/libs to the path in system settings

04.06.2008-21:19 < NehaP> no i didn't catch you
04.06.2008-21:19 < el_> hm, seems we all have some trouble with the connection today,,,
04.06.2008-21:19 < NehaP> ok
04.06.2008-21:20 < el_> neha, if that doesn;t work feel free to contact any of us before the next meeting
04.06.2008-21:20 < NehaP> sure
04.06.2008-21:21 <@boud> did you manage to get a wiki account?
04.06.2008-21:21 < seele> is building a live cd an option?  i dont know if the koffice guys can do that or not
04.06.2008-21:21 < NehaP> i had planned to do so but the past week was really busy for me
04.06.2008-21:21 < NehaP> that would be really good
04.06.2008-21:21 <@boud> it should be possible using opensuse's build service
04.06.2008-21:21 <@boud> we do have regularly updated suse packages now
04.06.2008-21:21 < el_> (i will have to get off in about 3 minutes. will then be back after ±10 mintues. sorry for that, very bad timing today)
04.06.2008-21:21 <@boud> ok
04.06.2008-21:21 < NehaP> not a prob
04.06.2008-21:22 <@boud> but for now, it should be easy to get the windows packages to work. I managed, and I'm not a windows guru by a long chalk
04.06.2008-21:22 < NehaP> yes i got a wiki account
04.06.2008-21:22 <@boud> good
04.06.2008-21:22 < el_> have you already done interviews with the koffice developers?
04.06.2008-21:22 <@boud> could you in the next week send a mail to koffice-devel@kde.org telling the developers about you and your project? Interest is really high and people are curious.
04.06.2008-21:22 < NehaP> sure i will really do that
04.06.2008-21:22 < el_> off...
04.06.2008-21:22 < el_> cu later
04.06.2008-21:23 < NehaP> i am all set for it now
04.06.2008-21:23 < NehaP> boud...after installation i could open application such as designer..is it someway or other related to our project
04.06.2008-21:24 <@boud> designer could be used to mockup a design, but I don't know whether that would be useful
04.06.2008-21:24 < NehaP> ok
04.06.2008-21:24 <@boud> that's for seele and el to advice you about, I guess.
04.06.2008-21:25 < seele> if you can figure out how to use it, but if you have different tools youre more comfortable using, go ahead
04.06.2008-21:25 < seele> did you begin any of the interviews yet?  i think that was ellens last question before she dropped
04.06.2008-21:25 < NehaP> because after the installation i could open applications such as assistant, assistant_adp, designer, linguistic and qdbusviewer
04.06.2008-21:25 < NehaP> no...not yet
04.06.2008-21:25 < NehaP> i don't think i m yet done with installation
04.06.2008-21:25 <@boud> NehaP: those are all pure qt apps, not kde apps. I think you need to do the kde4/lib trick.
04.06.2008-21:26 < NehaP> ok..i got u
04.06.2008-21:26 <@boud> I think I sent you a mail with a link to a howto some time ago
04.06.2008-21:26 < NehaP> i can start the inteviews with some general questions first if you want
04.06.2008-21:27 < NehaP> yes u send me an emaik
04.06.2008-21:27 < NehaP> email
04.06.2008-21:27 < NehaP> but it mentioned that the applications can be opened from the bin folder
04.06.2008-21:27 < seele> getting it installed and reviewing the software will probably be useful before you interview the developers
04.06.2008-21:27 < NehaP> yes..i think the same 
04.06.2008-21:28 <@boud> NehaP: if you want to have expert help, try to find saroengels on #kde-windows or #koffice on irc.
04.06.2008-21:28 <@boud> he can probably help you get it working in like ten minutes.
04.06.2008-21:28 < NehaP> thanks for letting me know this
04.06.2008-21:28 < NehaP> i will try doing this right away
04.06.2008-21:29 <@boud> he seems to be online now.
04.06.2008-21:30 < NehaP> i got him thanks

04.06.2008-21:53 <@boud> ok
04.06.2008-21:53 < seele> i think the next step would be the developer interviews

04.06.2008-21:53 < seele> and i think boud wanted you to introduce yourself on the koffice mailing list and talk more about your project

04.06.2008-21:55 < NehaP> hmmm

04.06.2008-22:00 < seele> just subscribed as well
04.06.2008-22:02 < el> so we are all up to date
04.06.2008-22:03 < seele> yes
04.06.2008-22:03 < el> i think i went offline directly after i asked -> neha, have you already talked/mailed with some developers?
04.06.2008-22:03 < seele> hehe, i think we've asked her that 5 times now
04.06.2008-22:03 < el> hehe
04.06.2008-22:03 < seele> she said not yet
04.06.2008-22:03 < el> ok, thanks
04.06.2008-22:04 < seele> it will help for her to review koffice first i think, but that should be resolved soon since she got some help
04.06.2008-22:04 < NehaP> well i m sorry for getting my work delayed
04.06.2008-22:04 < el> seele, maybe you can give some tips how you did it with the plasma people etc.
04.06.2008-22:04 < seele> so i guess that is next week's activity
04.06.2008-22:04 < seele> sure
04.06.2008-22:04 < NehaP> well I am talking to saroengels
04.06.2008-22:04 < seele> NehaP: have you done many interviews for user research before?
04.06.2008-22:04 < NehaP> and he is unable to solve my problem yet
04.06.2008-22:04 < NehaP> so he has asked me to reinstall the packages
04.06.2008-22:05 < el> puh....
04.06.2008-22:05 < NehaP> yes i have done many interviews
04.06.2008-22:05 < NehaP> uhhh...
04.06.2008-22:05 < el> maybe a live cd will be more easy?
04.06.2008-22:05 < NehaP> i am tired of installing this package
04.06.2008-22:05 < NehaP> i know...
04.06.2008-22:05 < NehaP> looks like this application rally needs usability help
04.06.2008-22:06 < NehaP> really*
04.06.2008-22:06 < seele> NehaP: one of the interview methods i've used before is the Delphi, id ont know if youve heard of it before?
04.06.2008-22:06 <@boud> well, it's not the windows installer we're going to work on: it isn't part of koffice
04.06.2008-22:06 < NehaP> no i haven't heard of it
04.06.2008-22:06 < seele> it is useful when you only have a few people to interview
04.06.2008-22:07 < NehaP> sounds interesting can u shed more light on this?
04.06.2008-22:07 < seele> basically you do your regular interview to start, but then at the end of the interview, you show (or tell) your participant of other information you gathered from previous participants
04.06.2008-22:07 < seele> this helps them think about things they might not have come up with, or comment for or against other people's views
04.06.2008-22:07 < seele> so you get more than independent data points that you try to find commonalities
04.06.2008-22:08 < seele> at the end of the interview after you talk about the previous results, they can change their mind about positions they might have had on a topic, or maintain their position
04.06.2008-22:09 < seele> ideas that might get snubbed out by one participant in an interview may reappear when another participant begins to discuss it, so it get's reintroduced in to the knowledge base
04.06.2008-22:10 < seele> it's useful because it helps developers comment on ideas they may have never thought of so you get more people talking about the same things instead of hoping that a topic or idea is popular enough to get mentioned
04.06.2008-22:11 < seele> there are levels of formality in the protocol, but for something like this, just keeping track of key points and then reviewing them at the end of the interview will be enough
04.06.2008-22:12 < NehaP> thanks seele 
04.06.2008-22:13 < NehaP> i will definitely implement it
04.06.2008-22:13 < seele> let me know if you have any questions, but it is pretty simple once you understand the concept
04.06.2008-22:13 < NehaP> sure
04.06.2008-22:13 < NehaP>  i am deleting it and reinstalling it
04.06.2008-22:13 < NehaP> which is going to take time
04.06.2008-22:14 < el> boud: which version of koffice is on the current opensuse live cd?
04.06.2008-22:15 < el> maybe that's enough for a first look, so that neha can start with the interviews and we'll find a better solution till next week?
04.06.2008-22:15 <@boud> el: I'm not sure, I'll need to ask around for it
04.06.2008-22:15 <@boud> el: in any case for the problem at hand, and old version is good enough
04.06.2008-22:16 <@boud> it looks, from the description at http://home.kde.org/~binner/kde-four-live/ to be a pretty recent version, compiled against 4.1beta
04.06.2008-22:16 <@boud> the 1.0.80 version, not the 1.0.4 version
04.06.2008-22:17 <@boud> yes, definitely good enough
04.06.2008-22:17 < el> koffice2-kword-1.9.95.4-2.19
04.06.2008-22:18 < el> neha, then better go for the live cd. 
04.06.2008-22:19 < NehaP> yeah...if no choice left
04.06.2008-22:24 < el> then we are done for today, right? 
04.06.2008-22:25 < NehaP> i am taking the help of saroengels till I am done today with the installation
04.06.2008-22:25 < el> cool
04.06.2008-22:25 <@boud> ok
04.06.2008-22:25 < NehaP> And for sure by this weekend i should be ready with the user profiles including interviewing
04.06.2008-22:26 < el> we might already fix a meeting for next week
04.06.2008-22:26 < el> or do you prefer doodle?
04.06.2008-22:26 < seele> let's doodle
04.06.2008-22:26 < el> ok
04.06.2008-22:26 <@boud> yes
04.06.2008-22:26 <@boud> it works best for me
04.06.2008-22:26 < seele> i'm going to be out of the country for most of next week so it wil lhave to be next thursday/friday or later
04.06.2008-22:26 < NehaP> works for me too
04.06.2008-22:27 < el> thursday evening i will be on a plane again. but friday/weekend works for me, too
04.06.2008-22:27 < NehaP> i am open next week
04.06.2008-22:27 < NehaP> any time will work for me
04.06.2008-22:28 <@boud> I need to go now
04.06.2008-22:28 < el> seele: where are you going next week?

24.07.2008-20:09 < nehap> sure
24.07.2008-20:10 < nehap> i go through the user profiles and performed the use case step by step
24.07.2008-20:10 < nehap> i used think aloud protocol to figure out what I was thinking and what I was doing
24.07.2008-20:11 < nehap> At some steps, it was easy whereas in some steps I had to play with the application just to figure out what certain terminologies mean
24.07.2008-20:12 < nehap> I then jotted down the features which were easy to perform and supported 
24.07.2008-20:12 <@boud> I can imagine (in fact, I can see from the doc) that it must have been a bit of a problem to work with an app that isn't finished yet.
24.07.2008-20:12 < nehap> and the features which were not supported or difficulted to perform
24.07.2008-20:13 < seele> are the use case scenarios for a single user type or different ones?  I see "Pamela" as the sample persona, but it would be useful to know if the use case applies to more than one user group
24.07.2008-20:13 < nehap> I also evaluated the application based on 10 usability heuristics, number of clicks and grouping of functions
24.07.2008-20:14 < nehap> well, the third use case scenario was of a graphic artis named Ben
24.07.2008-20:15 < seele> are you still working on it?  i only see 2 in the latest document you sent out
24.07.2008-20:15 < nehap> this user profile was supposed to create a brochure but I was not able to figure out how to prepare a brochure
24.07.2008-20:15 < seele> ah ok
24.07.2008-20:15 < nehap> No, I already did it.
24.07.2008-20:16 < nehap> I am sorry, I think I didn't send that document to you although I do remeber sending it to El
24.07.2008-20:16 < seele> should we do a third use case then?
24.07.2008-20:16 < nehap> I asked Thomas for help but didn't got any response
24.07.2008-20:16 < seele> i can think of one involving adding a table of contents and automatically number header levels
24.07.2008-20:16 < el> i'm not sure if production artist is really in the scope of kword - it's a very different workflos
24.07.2008-20:16 < el> workflow
24.07.2008-20:17 <@boud> I don't think adding a toc is already supported in the current version of kword
24.07.2008-20:17 < el> neha wanted to ask thomas bout it, but he hasn;t replied yet
24.07.2008-20:17 < seele> boud: what about number headers? (I was trying to figure out how to do it in OO the other day and failed)
24.07.2008-20:17 <@boud> seele: it's very much under development at the odf level right now.
24.07.2008-20:17 < seele> ok
24.07.2008-20:18 <@boud> seele: an interaction design as opposed to an analysis of how things work right now might be very useful
24.07.2008-20:18 < el> yes, i think we need to concentrate on analysing why the current tool-docker interaction doesnt work right
24.07.2008-20:18 < seele> so how things ought to work and now how badly they work now
24.07.2008-20:18 < el> and find a way to do it better
24.07.2008-20:18 < nehap> There are number of things which don't work right
24.07.2008-20:19 < nehap> Like I had problen inserting the table too.
24.07.2008-20:19 < nehap> problem
24.07.2008-20:19 < el> nehap: when doing the use cases, did you also use the dockers or mostly the menu? 
24.07.2008-20:19 <@boud> that's no wonder: we only have spreadsheet tables at the moment
24.07.2008-20:19 <@boud> no text tables, and probably won't have text tables for 2.0
24.07.2008-20:20 < nehap> @boud: ok
24.07.2008-20:20 < nehap> I used mostly menu and just few times dockers
24.07.2008-20:20 <@boud> nehap: if you mail thomas, please cc me: I might be able to prod thomas into action, if all else fails, by taking the action myself.
24.07.2008-20:21 < nehap> sure I will do it
24.07.2008-20:22 < seele> ok, so where should neha start, with a review of only the tool-docker?  or should she start from scratch?
24.07.2008-20:23 <@boud> tool docker, I think
24.07.2008-20:23 < el> the purpose of going through the use cases was actually to probe the docker-tool interaction
24.07.2008-20:23 < nehap> ok, I will do it
24.07.2008-20:24 < el> as boud mentioned, interaction with the dockers is not as fast as it should be
24.07.2008-20:24 < el> there are several reasons i think - bad grouping of the options on the dockers
24.07.2008-20:24 < nehap> hmmm
24.07.2008-20:24 < el> you have to change the tab frequently 
24.07.2008-20:24 < seele> right, but my question is that should she 1) do the review again with a focus on the tool docker, or 2) start a design of the tool docker from scratch and disregard the current design
24.07.2008-20:24 < seele> 1) would fix the current design, but 2) would have the opportunity to start over at the conceptual level
24.07.2008-20:25 <@boud> that's a good question
24.07.2008-20:25 < seele> el: what do you think?
24.07.2008-20:25 < seele> 2 is probably a bit harder to do
24.07.2008-20:25 <@boud> the current text tool option docker ui isn't particulary strong, nor is it so much code we wouldn't be able to redesign it
24.07.2008-20:26 <@boud> as for 2)
24.07.2008-20:26 < el> there was a long discussion on kword devel about dockers
24.07.2008-20:26 <@boud> casper boemann has made it possible to divide tool options over more than one docker, which might make a redesign even more interesting
24.07.2008-20:26 < seele> hum.. *checks archives*
24.07.2008-20:26 < el> yes
24.07.2008-20:26  * seele has been having problems with the wrong stuff getting marked as spam
24.07.2008-20:26 <@boud> thomas didn't like that, but he never likes anything he hasn't invented himself
24.07.2008-20:26 < el> so i think there are several people in koffice who wouldnt mind a redesign
24.07.2008-20:27 < seele> ah, yes, i did read that
24.07.2008-20:27 < el> i think it's important that we are backed up by the developers 
24.07.2008-20:27 < el> so i think 2 would be a good way (though you are right, it's more difficult to do)
24.07.2008-20:27 <@boud> casper will be back from holiday soon, and he is ready to work on the dockers
24.07.2008-20:28 <@boud> (unless, but this is a social issue, thomas manages to drive him away)
24.07.2008-20:28 < seele> since a lot of functionality is still missing, she would be creating a spec or framework for developers to add too
24.07.2008-20:28 < seele> she wont be able to design and document everything
24.07.2008-20:28 <@boud> that would be really useful, I think
24.07.2008-20:29 < seele> ok, so where to start
24.07.2008-20:29 < nehap> well I tried using dockers such as format tools and shape selectors, they are very very useful
24.07.2008-20:29 < nehap> Icons are important which are missing
24.07.2008-20:30 <@boud> that bug got fixed: it was in kde itself
24.07.2008-20:30 < el> yes, they will be added once for the final 2.0 version
24.07.2008-20:30 < nehap> May be that was the reason that even though it is such a good feature i didn't frrl like using it
24.07.2008-20:30 <@boud> we miss only a few icons, actually, but the icon loader was buggy.
24.07.2008-20:31 < seele> how does tool-docker currently work?  select and item -> select a tool?  or select a tool -> select/create item?
24.07.2008-20:31 < nehap> really, but I couldn't see even a single icon in the formatting tools
24.07.2008-20:31 <@boud> yes, it was a bad problem.
24.07.2008-20:31 <@boud> seele: actually, I'm having trouble figuring that out myself
24.07.2008-20:31 < seele> ok, that is one place to start
24.07.2008-20:31 < seele> defining the type of interactions
24.07.2008-20:31 <@boud> seele: some tools get activated when you select the right shape, some tools create a shape, and I can never figure that out.
24.07.2008-20:32 < seele> neha: make a note of that, it will be one of the things you have to figure out :)
24.07.2008-20:33 < seele> also, there are different classes of tools.  Some only create, some only modify, some are properties, etc., but then they could also be grouped by tasks or object context instead of function.
24.07.2008-20:33 < el> boud, does an object ever activate the select mode?
24.07.2008-20:33 < seele> So another goal would be to define what dimension everything is organized by
24.07.2008-20:34 <@boud> el: I don't think so
24.07.2008-20:36 < el> i think that everything is grouped by function/tools is one of the major problems. 
24.07.2008-20:38 < el> nehap: do you feel comfortable with starting at the conceptual level or would you prefer optimising what's there? i realise we didn't really ask you...
24.07.2008-20:41 -!- nehapahwa [n=pahwaneh@rm23397.rit.edu] has joined #sou-koffice
24.07.2008-20:41 < nehapahwa> I am dorry
24.07.2008-20:41 < nehapahwa> sorry
24.07.2008-20:41 < nehapahwa> My connection just went down
24.07.2008-20:41 < nehapahwa> I am back now
24.07.2008-20:41 < el> what was the last message you got?
24.07.2008-20:42 < nehapahwa> I was explaining about the charts and my connection went down
24.07.2008-20:43 < nehapahwa> Is there anything I missed out?
24.07.2008-20:43 < el> this will be a mess... but i simply copy/paste the previous conversation
24.07.2008-20:43 < el> seele: how does tool-docker currently work?  select and item -> select a tool?  or select a tool -> select/create item?
24.07.2008-20:43 < el> [20:30] nehap: really, but I couldn't see even a single icon in the formatting tools
24.07.2008-20:43 < el> [20:31] boud: yes, it was a bad problem.
24.07.2008-20:43 < el> [20:31] boud: seele: actually, I'm having trouble figuring that out myself
24.07.2008-20:43 < el> [20:31] seele: ok, that is one place to start
24.07.2008-20:43 < el> [20:31] seele: defining the type of interactions
24.07.2008-20:43 < el> [20:31] boud: seele: some tools get activated when you select the right shape, some tools create a shape, and I can never figure that out.

24.07.2008-20:43 < el> [20:38] el: nehap: do you feel comfortable with starting at the conceptual level or would you prefer optimising what's there? i realise we didn't really ask you...
24.07.2008-20:45 < nehapahwa> I am not sure, I haven't done something like this before
24.07.2008-20:45 < nehapahwa> I would go by mentor's decision
24.07.2008-20:46 < el> seele, what do you think? shall we still go for 2?
24.07.2008-20:46 < seele> el: i think it will give us the best design in the end
24.07.2008-20:47 < seele> otherwise we are fixing what we know is broken
24.07.2008-20:47 < seele> which sometimes works, but doesnt take advantage of koffice's alpha/beta state
24.07.2008-20:47 < seele> especially since there are developers interested in an alternative
24.07.2008-20:47 < el> yes, that for sure - but i think neha will need to take some time to get familiar with the docker conept in general
24.07.2008-20:48 < seele> maybe the first thing is to review dockers in other applications?  not just word processors but in different apps
24.07.2008-20:48 < el> yes, i think so too
24.07.2008-20:48 < el> do you know of other windows apps with dockers?
24.07.2008-20:48 <@boud> photoshop, in design, illustrator
24.07.2008-20:48 < seele> Photoshop, Flash, Axure, MS Office off the top of my head
24.07.2008-20:48 < el> i know the adobe suite uses it, right
24.07.2008-20:48 <@boud> on the mac, iWork is a good example
24.07.2008-20:49 < el> ms office? wow, didn't know that :)
24.07.2008-20:49 <@boud> the new lotus openoffice based thing uses dockers in an interesting way
24.07.2008-20:49 < seele> i have an old version
24.07.2008-20:49 < seele> i think open office does too
24.07.2008-20:49 < seele> for the presentation/drawing tools
24.07.2008-20:49 <@boud> ms killed my windows partition through a borked upgrade, but I had office2007 to compare
24.07.2008-20:49 < seele> yes, actually, the ribbon would be a good thing for her to look at as well
24.07.2008-20:49 <@boud> yes
24.07.2008-20:50 < seele> because it is organized very differently than the previous office tools were
24.07.2008-20:50 < el> yes - and you are using office 2007, right neha?
24.07.2008-20:50 < nehapahwa> I am very much familiar with MS Office
24.07.2008-20:50 < nehapahwa> 2207
24.07.2008-20:50 < nehapahwa> 2007...to be precise
24.07.2008-20:50 <@boud> although from a practicaly pov, implementing a proper ribbon in Qt will be quite hard -- apart from the problem that ms copyrighted and patented the design
24.07.2008-20:50 < nehapahwa> I really like the ribbon they have evolved
24.07.2008-20:51 <@boud> using it for to check up on organisation of functionality is ok; but a design that includes a ribbon will be a problem.
24.07.2008-20:51 < seele> no, but it is something to look at becasue it is different
24.07.2008-20:51 < seele> especially the organization
24.07.2008-20:51 < seele> sure
24.07.2008-20:51 < el> it's task oriented - that's something we should look at
24.07.2008-20:51 <@boud> I must say that 2007 was the first word since word 2.0 I liked :-)
24.07.2008-20:52 < nehapahwa> I like 2007 too :-)
24.07.2008-20:52 < el> so what are the goals when she's looking at other applications? 
24.07.2008-20:52 < el> a) other word apps: how do they organise their options?
24.07.2008-20:52 < nehapahwa> Well, while evaluating the use cases I looked at Word 2007 too
24.07.2008-20:52 < seele> interaction of the tools with objects
24.07.2008-20:52 < seele> how the tools are organized
24.07.2008-20:52 < el> b) other docker apps: interaction
24.07.2008-20:53 < seele> the types of things the tools can do.  do they just enable an option or do they have a richer interaction (e.g. photoshop's dockers do more than just enable a tool)
24.07.2008-20:53 -!- nehap [n=pahwaneh@rm23397.rit.edu] has quit [Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)]
24.07.2008-20:53 < seele> oh, Krita has tool dockers
24.07.2008-20:53 < seele> doh
24.07.2008-20:53 < el> kword, too
24.07.2008-20:54 < seele> does abi word use dockers or is it just a straight toolbar?
24.07.2008-20:54 <@boud> all koffice apps except kexi and kplato use them
24.07.2008-20:54 <@boud> abiword is basically word 2.0: no dockers
24.07.2008-20:54 < seele> ok
24.07.2008-20:56 < el> nehapahwa: in kword, the "tools" docker changes its contents depending on the object tool that is currently selected. that is when you select the text tool, it will show you text options. when you select the paint tool, it will show you paint options. then, there is a special select tool which will show you "select" options (rotate, etc)
24.07.2008-20:56 < el> it would be interesting to see how other applications do that
24.07.2008-20:56 <@boud> yes
24.07.2008-20:56 <@boud> (in all koffice apps, it's basically the same, of course)
24.07.2008-20:56 < el> do they also switch the contents of the tool docker? is that good or bad? why so?
24.07.2008-20:57 < nehapahwa> sure...i will check that out
24.07.2008-20:57 < el> and importantly, how do others do the select - in koffice, it's a separate mode
24.07.2008-20:57 < el> this is not very handy
24.07.2008-20:57 <@boud> maybe interesting to know that photoshop moved the contents of its tool docker (which was in top-right like ours) to a top toolbar between 5.5 and 6.0
24.07.2008-20:58 <@boud> it works for them because they use pop-outs a lot
24.07.2008-20:58 < el> boud, you mean the tool options or the toolbox?
24.07.2008-20:58 < el> tool options i suppose?
24.07.2008-20:58 <@boud> tool options docker
24.07.2008-20:58 <@boud> the toolbox hasn't moved since the original mac paint :-)
24.07.2008-20:59 < el> hehe
24.07.2008-20:59 <@boud> everyone seems to be facing the same problem: Peter Sikking was telling me about his woes at lgm
24.07.2008-20:59 < el> and do you feel it's an advantage? or haven't you used it yourself?
24.07.2008-20:59 <@boud> the reason we put the option docker to the right is to accommodate wide screens -- maximize vertical work space
24.07.2008-21:00 <@boud> but that gave us a problem in that the distance between toolbox and tooldocker is very large
24.07.2008-21:00 < el> yeah, but in a toolbar you cannot put the full widgets - so you have more clicks. but well, depends of the design of the toolbar widgets..
24.07.2008-21:00 <@boud> yes..
24.07.2008-21:01 <@boud> I can invent all kinds of technical solutions that look cool, but I'm not an interaction designer.
24.07.2008-21:01 <@boud> like semi-transparent floats that popup under the mouse on ctrl-shift-alt-meta-click
24.07.2008-21:01 < el> hehe
24.07.2008-21:02 < nehapahwa> :-)
24.07.2008-21:05 <@boud> I actually think that that is close to what Peter Sikking wants for the Gimp, but gtk cannot support that. We could support it with Qt, if it is a sound design.
24.07.2008-21:06 < seele> do you think neha should talk with peter?
24.07.2008-21:06 < seele> i dont know how busy he is, i think he is at a conference for printing now
24.07.2008-21:06 <@boud> he'll be at akademy, I know that.
24.07.2008-21:06 <@boud> peter is generally busy enough that I only manage to speak with him when I meet him at lgm.
24.07.2008-21:06 < seele> oh, speaking of akademy
24.07.2008-21:06 < seele> el: after this meeting can we talk about other htings?

24.07.2008-21:07 < el> i know he hasn't before the lgm, but i think he wanted to work on it there
24.07.2008-21:07 <@boud> I haven't seen anything yet
24.07.2008-21:08 <@boud> which only means he hasn't blogged about it

02.08.2008-15:05 < nehap> hello everybody
02.08.2008-15:05 <@boud> hi nehap 
02.08.2008-15:07 < nehap> hello @boud
02.08.2008-15:07 < nehap> please check your mail, i have send the latest document for review.
02.08.2008-15:08 < seele> ok
02.08.2008-15:09 < seele> does MS have plans to eventually support odf?
02.08.2008-15:10  * seele is reading the newest mail
02.08.2008-15:11 < nehap> MS Office 2007 supports ODF
02.08.2008-15:11 < nehap> http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/may08/05-21ExpandedFormatsPR.mspx
02.08.2008-15:11 < nehap> here's the link
02.08.2008-15:11 < nehap> When using SP2, customers will be able to open, edit and save documents using ODF and save documents into the XPS and PDF fixed formats from directly within the application without having to install any other code. It will also allow customers to set ODF as the default file format for Office 2007.
02.08.2008-15:14 <@boud> what's the difference between black and blue text?
02.08.2008-15:15 < seele> nehap: ah, nice.  you should start using odf instead of doc format then :)
02.08.2008-15:16 < nehap> ok :)
02.08.2008-15:17 < seele> 1-5 deal with tools themselves and then 6 deals with the actual tool options functionality, correct?
02.08.2008-15:17 < nehap> Black text was for the problems and I thought I would use blue text for solution/design but it somehow got mixed up.
02.08.2008-15:17 < nehap> Sorry for that
02.08.2008-15:17 <@boud> I wondered whether black was yours and blue comments by seele or el :-)
02.08.2008-15:18 <@boud> I think this shows a pretty good grasp of the problems
02.08.2008-15:18 < seele> i agree
02.08.2008-15:18 < nehap> @boud: oh no, its being done by me
02.08.2008-15:18 < seele> nehap: why dont you review what is in #6, that has some solutions for how you would change the tool options
02.08.2008-15:18 < nehap> seele: well the 6th one is very problematic
02.08.2008-15:19 < seele> nehap: that's why we will discuss it :)
02.08.2008-15:19 < nehap> it exist as one of the dockers and not just the functionality
02.08.2008-15:19 < seele> you have some questions written, maybe boud can help answer them
02.08.2008-15:19 <@boud> well... 
02.08.2008-15:20 <@boud> maybe start with "Thus, the question is what exactly does the tool option provide? "
02.08.2008-15:20 < nehap> * looking at my own document
02.08.2008-15:20 <@boud> basically, the tool option docker is a single docker (although it might be split into several) that shows the options associated with the currently selected tool
02.08.2008-15:21 <@boud> the geometry etc. docker is associated with the default tool: the top-left arrow icon
02.08.2008-15:21 <@boud> clicking on the text should activate the text tool, which should activate the text tool options
02.08.2008-15:23 < seele> so one of the design options nehap is suggesting is organizing the tools in to tabs or some other component instead of throwing them all together?
02.08.2008-15:23 < nehap> yes seele
02.08.2008-15:23 < seele> what is the difference between just using tabs and implementing something similar to the ribbon?  isn't the ribbon just a set of tabs?
02.08.2008-15:23 < seele> or is there something else significant about the ribbon i'm missing.  i know how they organize the tools is another big part
02.08.2008-15:24 < seele> boud: any idea how much or what parts of the ribbon are patented?  just the display method or the organization too?
02.08.2008-15:24 <@boud> could someone point me to an example of the photoshop quick selection tools?
02.08.2008-15:24 < nehap> well ribbon is a set of tabs and then those tabs have their options in dropdown fashion whereas I am trying to use subtabs
02.08.2008-15:24 <@boud> seele: basically the whole ui concept
02.08.2008-15:26 < seele> gah
02.08.2008-15:26 <@boud> ms has told its own customers they'd have to pay if they wanted to use the ribbon concept in their own applications
02.08.2008-15:26 < seele> nehap: what part of photoshop tools are "quick selection"?  the tool boxes or the options in the tool bar?
02.08.2008-15:26 <@boud> I've only got photoshop 7 here
02.08.2008-15:27 < seele> that's total crap.  i could understand them patenting organization, because that would take a lot of research and development
02.08.2008-15:27 < seele> and maybe the exact specification for the UI and interaction
02.08.2008-15:27 < seele> but not the entire thing together, theyre two separate problems
02.08.2008-15:27  * seele hates patenting in general..
02.08.2008-15:27 < nehap> @boud:http://www.freetimefoto.com/photoshop/cs3/quick_selection_tool.html
02.08.2008-15:27 <@boud> yes...
02.08.2008-15:27 < nehap> here is the link for an example of quick selection tool
02.08.2008-15:28 <@boud> thanks
02.08.2008-15:28 < seele> boud: for example, what if we sunk a million euros in to user research for tool organization and came up with the same organization as MS?  they have precedence
02.08.2008-15:28 <@boud> I think I see
02.08.2008-15:28 <@boud> seele: we wouldn't be able to implement and not be sued
02.08.2008-15:28 < seele> boud: ah, yeah.  so you first select a generic tool, and then you refine the tool and it gives you specific options
02.08.2008-15:29 < seele> so say you click on the pain brush, which could be the paint brush or pencil
02.08.2008-15:29 <@boud> yes
02.08.2008-15:29 < seele> you would make that selection in the toolbar
02.08.2008-15:29  * seele doesnt remember if 7 has this or not
02.08.2008-15:29 < seele> is 7 cs1 or is it before the creative suite?
02.08.2008-15:29 <@boud> it's the same principle we have, really, with a toolbox and options for the tools, but the tool options isn't a palette but a toolbar
02.08.2008-15:29 < seele> yeah
02.08.2008-15:29 <@boud> they changed from a palette to toolbar in 6
02.08.2008-15:30 < nehap> quick selection tools cmprise of number of tools such as magic wand, crop, stamp etc. And these tools are placed in a box on the left side of the window
02.08.2008-15:30 <@boud> but those are only shown if you've selected the selection tool in the toolbox, right?
02.08.2008-15:31 < seele> how does selecting an object effect the tools available?  do you disable tools which don't appyl or do you still want to allow all tools to be selectable?
02.08.2008-15:31 <@boud> I really should get a newer photoshop myself :-)
02.08.2008-15:31 <@boud> in koffice or in photoshop?
02.08.2008-15:31 < seele> in koffice
02.08.2008-15:31 < seele> photoshop's objects work a little differently than objects in koffice
02.08.2008-15:31 < seele> you can also do something with a tool seelcted in photoshop, you dont have a context problem
02.08.2008-15:32 < seele> if you have a text layer selected and you want to draw a box, it just creates a new layer (i think, i dont have it open)
02.08.2008-15:32 <@boud> some tools are disabled or disappear if they aren't useful for the active shape.
02.08.2008-15:32 <@boud> other tools are used to create new shapes, so they are always active
02.08.2008-15:32 < seele> but if you have an object selected in a document, should we only allow tools which can be applied to that object?  
02.08.2008-15:32 < seele> ah ok
02.08.2008-15:33 <@boud> hm, I see that the text tool no longer appears in krita when I create a text shape
02.08.2008-15:33 <@boud> and then there are tools that affect your view: zoom and pan
02.08.2008-15:33 < seele> nehap: so i think the next step is in two parts.  one would be mocking up one or all three of the solutions you suggest and use some sample tools
02.08.2008-15:33 < nehap> @boud: what does pan do?
02.08.2008-15:34 < seele> nehap: i think you should do at least two so we can compare pros and cons
02.08.2008-15:34 <@boud> it moves the viewport over the document if not all of the document fits in the window
02.08.2008-15:34 < seele> nehap: the second part is to begin organizing tools to see how they would be displayed and organized
02.08.2008-15:34 < seele> nehap: do you have any more questions you need to ask me or boud about koffice or design in general?
02.08.2008-15:35 <@boud> would it save time if I mailed a list of all tools & what they do, or would that hamper the categorizing effort?
02.08.2008-15:35 < nehap> seele: I am not sure how do I go with the first part?
02.08.2008-15:35 < nehap> @boud: that would be helpful i suppose
02.08.2008-15:36 < seele> The tools on the left can be placed in the tool options docker as tabs. This means a single window of tool options docker will have all the tools in the form of tab. The features of the tools can be shown as sub tabs. Eg., as soon as you select a tool tab such as zoom, the rest of the tools  tabs should grey out. And only the features of zoom such as zoom in and zoom out should be displayed in the docker’s window which opens at the right side of th
02.08.2008-15:36 < nehap> seele: and for the second part do you want me to make sketches
02.08.2008-15:36 < seele> OR
02.08.2008-15:36 < seele> Make it like Adobe Photoshop Quick Selection Tools. When user selects the tool, no docker window should appear on right. If needed, use dialog boxes.
02.08.2008-15:37 < seele> nehap: mock those two designs up so we can compare pros and cons and see how it fits in with koffice
02.08.2008-15:37 < seele> nehap: the second part (tool organization), they don't have to be mockups, you can just create groups in a text document,
02.08.2008-15:38 < seele> nehap: you can also try to use some of the tool orgs you come up with as samples in your mockups for part 1
02.08.2008-15:38 < seele> does that make more sense?
02.08.2008-15:39 < seele> sketches or mockups for the tool option system, and notes or sketches on how the tools could be organzied and all their options
02.08.2008-15:39 < nehap> seele: i am sorry seele..i am really confused.
02.08.2008-15:39 < nehap> ok so for first part, i need to create sketches
02.08.2008-15:40 < seele> ok.. part number 1: the actual tool option system.  you proposed three things in your document: the ribbon, left docker, or adobe style
02.08.2008-15:40 < seele> i want you to create sketches/mockups of how that would work in koffice using one or more of the existing tools
02.08.2008-15:40 < nehap> and second part could include notes which describe how to group functions together
02.08.2008-15:40 < nehap> got you!!! :)
02.08.2008-15:40 < seele> yes exactly!
02.08.2008-15:40 < seele> yay!
02.08.2008-15:41 < seele> sorry if i wastn clear enough
02.08.2008-15:41 < nehap> :)
02.08.2008-15:41 < nehap> no thats fine
02.08.2008-15:41 < seele> so if you think the tool groups might differ depending on the tool option system, you might want to make a note of it as well
02.08.2008-15:41 < seele> as it is, we can't use the ribbon concept.. but you might be able to get some ideas to create your own concept from it
02.08.2008-15:42 < nehap> sure
02.08.2008-15:42 < nehap> ok
02.08.2008-15:42 < seele> any questions?
02.08.2008-15:43 < nehap> i am good for now
02.08.2008-15:43 < seele> ok cool.  boud do you have anything else? 
02.08.2008-15:43 < seele> can someone send ellen the logs?  i dont have logging on in irssi
02.08.2008-15:44 <@boud> i can do that
02.08.2008-15:44 < seele> cool thanks
02.08.2008-15:44 < seele> nehap: do you think we can meet again next week or will you need a few extra days to talk?
02.08.2008-15:44 <@boud> gawd, I hate the table function of oowriter -- selecting stuff never works like I want
02.08.2008-15:44 < seele> nehap: next weekend ellen and i will be at akademy so our schedules will be messed up
02.08.2008-15:45 < seele> boud: are you going to akademy?
02.08.2008-15:45 < nehap> I think Friday should be a good time
02.08.2008-15:45 <@boud> I thought not
02.08.2008-15:45 <@boud> but there's a small chance I will appear one or two days
02.08.2008-15:45 <@boud> to talk to some nokia guys about a possible job
02.08.2008-15:45 < seele> boud: ok.. see you there hopefully :)
02.08.2008-15:45 < seele> nehap: i'll have to check with ellen, i'm not sure when she is arriving
02.08.2008-15:45 <@boud> hopefully :-)
02.08.2008-15:45 < seele> i get in in the AM CET so i can meet as long as i have internet
02.08.2008-15:46 < nehap> seele: are you planning to attend HFES annual meet in september
02.08.2008-15:46 < nehap> ?
02.08.2008-15:46 < seele> nehap: probably not, i've already used 21 days vacation this year for my job :D
02.08.2008-15:46 < seele> nehap: i usually only go to a conference if i present, otherwise i would always travel and never work
02.08.2008-15:46 < nehap> oh, ok
02.08.2008-15:46 < seele> i went to UPA in June
02.08.2008-15:47 < seele> probably CHI next year because it is in Boston (1.5 hr flight from DC)
02.08.2008-15:47 < nehap> great, my professors went to UPA meet
02.08.2008-15:47 < nehap> yeah...NYC is like an hour flight from my place, so I might attend hFES
02.08.2008-15:47 < seele> cool, maybe i talked with them!  i was helping my graduate school with their booth by talking about the program 
02.08.2008-15:48 < seele> will your school pay for it?  
02.08.2008-15:48 < nehap> great!!
02.08.2008-15:48 < nehap> i am not sure, i have asked them but no answer yet:(
02.08.2008-15:48 < seele> good luck with that, i hope they at least pay for registration
02.08.2008-15:49 < nehap> yeah!! its just $185 for whole week
02.08.2008-15:49 < nehap> so should not be a big deal for such a big school :)
02.08.2008-15:50 < nehap> does HFES hold good opprtunities for students who are looking for full time opportunities in HCI?
02.08.2008-15:51 < seele> as a profession?  it depends on where you work
02.08.2008-15:51 < seele> in DC it is big because there is a lot of government and aeronautics
02.08.2008-15:51 < seele> and a big usability industry
02.08.2008-15:51 < seele> Boston is good for that too
02.08.2008-15:52 < seele> all of the human factors engineers i know do a lot of user research and testing
02.08.2008-15:52 < nehap> well, i am an international student with no security clearance, this makes my job harder
02.08.2008-15:52 < nehap> thats good!!
02.08.2008-15:52 < seele> nehap: i would look at human factors international and see if htey have any internships in your area
02.08.2008-15:52 < seele> i know a few people who work for them too
02.08.2008-15:53 < nehap> thanks seele
02.08.2008-15:53 < nehap> i appreciate it!!
02.08.2008-15:53 < seele> they have offices all over the world, so even if they cant hire you in the US, they might have something somewhere else
02.08.2008-15:53 < seele> i know they have a big office in india and one in china
02.08.2008-15:53 < nehap> sounds good!!
02.08.2008-15:53 < seele> good luck
02.08.2008-15:53 < nehap> thanks seele
02.08.2008-15:54 < seele> talk to you next week, let me know if you have any questions
02.08.2008-15:54 <@boud> same here
02.08.2008-15:54 <@boud> I'll mail my list of tools round today
02.08.2008-15:55 < nehap> sure, thanks @boud, thanks seele
02.08.2008-15:55 < nehap> talk to you next week
02.08.2008-15:56 <@boud> I might miss one or two, though -- these tools breed like white mice

22.08.2008-20:11 < el_> hi nehap 
22.08.2008-20:11  * el_ is still reading the documents you sent
22.08.2008-20:13 < el_> i'm done - seele, what about you?
22.08.2008-20:14 < seele> sorry had a phone call.. still reading
22.08.2008-20:15 < seele> nehapahwa: you have very nice handwriting!
22.08.2008-20:17 < nehapahwa> :) thanks seele
22.08.2008-20:17 < el_> oh no, kword just crashed... :-//
22.08.2008-20:17 < el_> now that i painted such a lot of nice things 
22.08.2008-20:18 < seele> ok done
22.08.2008-20:18 < seele> nehapahwa: if you are looking for a design tool, axure has a 30 day unlimited trial period
22.08.2008-20:18 < seele> i think they have student rates too, but they are still expensive
22.08.2008-20:18 < seele> i think you can go in the registry and reset the trial period though
22.08.2008-20:19 < el_> i have an axure beta version
22.08.2008-20:19 < el_> you can use it if you set the date to somehting before april 2008 before starting the app ;-)
22.08.2008-20:19 < el_> i will send you a link later, nehap 
22.08.2008-20:19 < nehapahwa> i never heard about it, thanks for letting me know about it
22.08.2008-20:19 < nehapahwa> thanks el

22.08.2008-20:20 < el_> you can reset the date as soon as axure is started, hehe, that's so cool :)
22.08.2008-20:20 < nehapahwa> that's smart :)
22.08.2008-20:20 < el_> so - back to your work. it's really good i think!
22.08.2008-20:21 < nehapahwa> thanks el!!
22.08.2008-20:21 < seele> i had a question about greying out tabs, is that only for paths creation?
22.08.2008-20:22 < seele> i dont see it mentioned for the other tools
22.08.2008-20:22 < nehapahwa> no, its for every tab
22.08.2008-20:22 < nehapahwa> i just wrote it initially, i am sorry i should have made it clea
22.08.2008-20:22 < nehapahwa> clear
22.08.2008-20:23 < el_> i wonder if we cannot have the same effect by changing the title of the tool docker to the name of the tab title
22.08.2008-20:23 < el_> so when you click a shape, the title is "shape docker" instead of "tool docker"
22.08.2008-20:23 < seele> yeah
22.08.2008-20:24 < el_> or rather "Geometry" (as that's the default tool docker, right?)_
22.08.2008-20:24 < nehapahwa> yes...that would be more clear
22.08.2008-20:25 < nehapahwa> the default tool option has actually three tabs: geometry, advanced and transformation
22.08.2008-20:25 < nehapahwa> i just combined all three in one
22.08.2008-20:25 < nehapahwa> but yes it definitely refers to the geometrical shapes and figures
22.08.2008-20:26 < el_> advanced is order, transformation, etc?
22.08.2008-20:26 < el_> maybe we still find a better title. i wouldn't expect order under geometry
22.08.2008-20:28 < nehapahwa> Currently, order is under the advanced tab
22.08.2008-20:28 < el_> i'm a bit unsure about formatting - should it be a separate docker or should it replace the "geometry" docker?
22.08.2008-20:28 < nehapahwa> Format Docker actually exist seperately.
22.08.2008-20:29 < nehapahwa> We should stick to that format docker when we are dealing with text
22.08.2008-20:31 < el_> we need it, definitely. i just wonder if it should be permanently shown or if it should disappear when the user clicks a shape or creates a path
22.08.2008-20:31 < el_> the latter would be the same behaviour as the current tool option when you are writing
22.08.2008-20:31 < el_> it disappears when you select a shape
22.08.2008-20:31 < el_> but i think it makes sense to keep it permanently visible
22.08.2008-20:32 < el_> hopefully, one day it will be possible to add text to a shape, then you need formatting optons for a shape
22.08.2008-20:32 < el_> (you need both formatting and moving at the same time)
22.08.2008-20:32 -!- nehap [n=pahwaneh@rm23397.rit.edu] has joined #sou-koffice
22.08.2008-20:33 < nehap> Did I missed on something, I am sorry my mIRC was crashed :(
22.08.2008-20:33 < el_> what was the last you read?
22.08.2008-20:33 < nehap> I was explaining about the tool options in my sketches
22.08.2008-20:33 < nehap> <nehapahwa> But when we are dealing with shapes and geometrical figures, then the user should select tool options (or a much better title), and the same window would appear as I have proposed
22.08.2008-20:33 < nehap> <nehapahwa> in my sketches
22.08.2008-20:34 < el_> ok, i wrote the following:
22.08.2008-20:35 < el_> (i was referring to the format docker)
22.08.2008-20:35 < el_> el_: we need it, definitely. i just wonder if it should be permanently shown or if it should disappear when the user clicks a shape or creates a path
22.08.2008-20:35 < el_> [20:31] el_: the latter would be the same behaviour as the current tool option when you are writing
22.08.2008-20:35 < el_> [20:31] el_: it disappears when you select a shape
22.08.2008-20:35 < el_> [20:31] el_: but i think it makes sense to keep it permanently visible
22.08.2008-20:35 < el_> [20:32] el_: hopefully, one day it will be possible to add text to a shape, then you need formatting optons for a shape
22.08.2008-20:35 < el_> we should work out what the user wants to do when a certain tool is selectd
22.08.2008-20:36 < el_> as you can see above, when thedefault tool is selected, you might want to do more than only changing the geometry
22.08.2008-20:36 < el_> you might want to change the font style of that shape to bold
22.08.2008-20:36 < el_> but you might also want to change the color of that shape - currently there is no way to do that
22.08.2008-20:37 < nehap> yes, i pointed these features in my last document
22.08.2008-20:37 < el_> right
22.08.2008-20:37 < el_> and i think the challenge now is to find out what exactly would people like to do with objects
22.08.2008-20:37 < el_> and how to present that in the dockers
22.08.2008-20:38 < el_> possibly, one docker is not enough per tool (see the shapes example - you want to change color and position)
22.08.2008-20:40 < nehap> that's true, but will the users use such a wide variety of features just for the shapes; kword is a text based application 
22.08.2008-20:40 < nehap> like transformation, shearing, scaling, gradient editing, pan 
22.08.2008-20:41 < el_> that's exactly what you should define next
22.08.2008-20:41 < el_> go through each single type of object you might have in a document, and define what the most important functionality is
22.08.2008-20:41 < nehap> I believe that we should give easy access to users to tables, charts, basic geometrical figures
22.08.2008-20:42 < nehap> hmmmm....got you
22.08.2008-20:42 < el_> yes, and now try to go one step further and define what users will do with tables, charts, figures, pictures...
22.08.2008-20:42 < nehap> sounds good...
22.08.2008-20:43 < el_> i fully agree with you that a lot of the options in the current dockers are not suitable for kword
22.08.2008-20:44 < el_> they are for krita, where users will do high-end image editing
22.08.2008-20:44 < nehap> yes...
22.08.2008-20:44 < nehap> I believe we should give users more features related to text
22.08.2008-20:44 < el_> i think a lot of what you define for kword will be re-usable for kpresenter
22.08.2008-20:44 < nehap> hmm..
22.08.2008-20:44 < nehap> yeah
22.08.2008-20:45 < el_> for the text formatting, i think i should explain the paragraph and character style thing
22.08.2008-20:46 < el_> the idea behind having those styles is that users apply a generic formatting, like in html
22.08.2008-20:46 < el_> when you mark a heading as <heading 1> in html, you can change the template of the document later on and the heading will still be a heading
22.08.2008-20:46 < el_> that's exactly what the kword people want to accomplish here with the styles
22.08.2008-20:47 < el_> users should not set a font type and size for a single line of text, but should use predefined styles
22.08.2008-20:47 < el_> so when you realise "i don't like how headings look in this document" you will only have to change one style, and not each single heading in the document
22.08.2008-20:48 < el_> that's why they do not provide "font type" and "font size" in the docker
22.08.2008-20:48 < el_> got it?
22.08.2008-20:49 < el_> i like the concept of using styles, though i do not really understand the separation of paragraph and character styles
22.08.2008-20:50 -!- nehapahwa [n=pahwaneh@rm23397.rit.edu] has quit [Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)]
22.08.2008-20:50 < nehap> yes..i got it
22.08.2008-20:51 < el_> when you think about the formatting docker, consider the styles concept. but if you find it important (from a users perspective) that there are font types and sizes, re-add them
22.08.2008-20:52 < nehap> well with paragraph style, i mean to state that the formatting can be done such as giving space after every paragraph
22.08.2008-20:52 < nehap> or giving space within the lines of the paragraph
22.08.2008-20:52 < el_> right. but when you probe it, it also applies a character style (font size, font type)
22.08.2008-20:53 < el_> and honestly, if it wouldn't, it would be very bothersome to always press twice "heading 1" to get both the proper alignment and font type
22.08.2008-20:53 < nehap> yeah...i understood you
22.08.2008-20:53 < nehap> i misinterpreted it
22.08.2008-20:54 < el_> it's confusing in the current way, that's all i wanted to explain in these many words :)
22.08.2008-20:54 < nehap> i got you :) i myself got confused several timings
22.08.2008-20:55 < nehap> times*
22.08.2008-20:55 < el_> :)
22.08.2008-20:56 < el_> ok, so the task for next meeting is to look at the objects in a document and define what you might want to do with it / what options need to be available for it
22.08.2008-20:56 < nehap> ok
22.08.2008-20:57 < nehap> so when are we meeting next?
22.08.2008-20:58 < el_> season of usability is almost done, so i think this is more or less our last task. we will talk about it next week, and then you should still put it into a "presentable" form afterwards. ok?
22.08.2008-20:59 < nehap> yes....but is it possible that I can still be involved with this work even if the season of usability is ending
22.08.2008-20:59 < el_> wow, that would be nice :)
22.08.2008-20:59 < nehap> great:)
22.08.2008-20:59 < el_> :)
22.08.2008-21:00 < el_> next meeting, hm, when are you available?
22.08.2008-21:00 < nehap> thursday or friday are the most suitable days for me
22.08.2008-21:01 < el_> i'm on a concert thursday evening. let's send a mail to the others to see if they are available friday
22.08.2008-21:03 < el_> ok, neha, then thanks for your work - i really think we're getting somewhere :)
22.08.2008-21:06 < seele> sorry, i had a phone call
22.08.2008-21:07 < seele> hmm.. next friday if it is at 11/5 or after 4/10 unfortunately
22.08.2008-21:07 < el_> maybe saturday then?
22.08.2008-21:08 < el_> 11/5 would be fine with me, too, though
22.08.2008-21:08 < el_> but boud is probably still at work

29.08.2008-17:14 < el_> give me a few minutes to read.... 
29.08.2008-17:15 < nehap> hi el...please take your time
29.08.2008-17:21 < el_> ok, done with reading and just starting up my koffice...
29.08.2008-17:21 < el_> nehap: for the text tool options - do you suggest to show all the options you describe in the document onto one tab or would you split it?

29.08.2008-17:26 < el_> first and foremost, for my understanding: did you find the options (style, size, colors, etc) you describe here in koffice or is that how you think it _should_ be? i'm not quite sure because the heading says "KWord offers a wide variety..." while i don't find it in koffice that way
29.08.2008-17:26 < el_> ah, hehe, welcome back :)
29.08.2008-17:27 < neha_p> i am sorry my internet connection went down
29.08.2008-17:27 < el_> no prob
29.08.2008-17:27 < neha_p> :) These options are already present in the Kword
29.08.2008-17:28 < neha_p> I would like to define all these functionalities under one tab. Even in my sketch last week,
29.08.2008-17:28 < neha_p> I had tried to put all these functionalities under the tool options tab.
29.08.2008-17:29 < el_> yes, i think that's good. you should have the most important functionality in one click
29.08.2008-17:29 < el_> celeste just sent a mail if we should meet at 12/6
29.08.2008-17:29 < el_> did you see it?
29.08.2008-17:30 < neha_p> yeah..when the user will be working with the text, he at some point or the other going to use all these functionalities...checking celeste email
29.08.2008-17:31 < neha_p> I am available till 12:20
29.08.2008-17:31 < neha_p> I have my capstone meeting at 12:30
29.08.2008-17:31 < neha_p> will this work?
29.08.2008-17:32 < el_> maybe a bit too short
29.08.2008-17:32 < el_> let's continue and celeste will join in 
29.08.2008-17:33 < neha_p> ok
29.08.2008-17:33 < el_> to come back to the question above - how exactly did you come up with the options? is all that available in koffice but you re-arranged/re-prioritised it?
29.08.2008-17:34 < neha_p> yes these are all available in Koffice, i actually re arranged them
29.08.2008-17:35 < el_> ok. can you create a visual mockup for that? that would be great
29.08.2008-17:35 < el_> have you tried axure btw?
29.08.2008-17:35 < neha_p> I am sorry, not yet :(
29.08.2008-17:36 < el_> no worries - it is helpful to create mockups with real comboboxes, checkboxes, etc
29.08.2008-17:36 < neha_p> yes...i understand that
29.08.2008-17:36 < el_> otherwise you can first do a hand-drawn mockup
29.08.2008-17:36 < el_> that's also fine
29.08.2008-17:37 < neha_p> I will try doing it with axure this time
29.08.2008-17:37 -!- seele [i=seele@nayuki.caffeine.nu] has joined #sou-koffice
29.08.2008-17:37 < seele> hi
29.08.2008-17:37 < neha_p> hi seele
29.08.2008-17:37 < el_> hi seele!
29.08.2008-17:38 < seele> ok, opening neha's doc
29.08.2008-17:38 < el_> we are still in the first section about text options
29.08.2008-17:39 < el_> neha wrote down what options should be available when writing text (it's all available in kword already but needs to be rearranged)
29.08.2008-17:40 < seele> that's everything before the Shape section, correct?
29.08.2008-17:40 < el_> yes
29.08.2008-17:42 < seele> what about highlight/background color?
29.08.2008-17:42 -!- nehap [n=pahwaneh@rm23397.rit.edu] has quit [Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)]
29.08.2008-17:42 < el_> neha, i g
29.08.2008-17:42 < el_> ups
29.08.2008-17:42 < seele> i'm not sure about bullets/numbering and indentation, that seems to be more related to paragraph than text
29.08.2008-17:43 < seele> although, same with alignment
29.08.2008-17:43 < seele> so maybe they are expected with text
29.08.2008-17:43 < seele> currently that is how open office groups them, but i wonder if they are really associated with "text" instead of "paragraph" or not
29.08.2008-17:43 < el_> the question is if we provide two different dockers for text and paragraph
29.08.2008-17:43 < el_> but we have to show both at the same time when writing anyway
29.08.2008-17:44 < neha_p> yeah...i agree with el
29.08.2008-17:44 < neha_p> numbering/intending is also the most commonly used feature along with font, size and style
29.08.2008-17:44 < el_> that's true
29.08.2008-17:45 < neha_p> seele: the background color is described in the section 'colors'
29.08.2008-17:45 < el_> i also got some questions about the actual design of some of the options
29.08.2008-17:45 < el_> currently, kword does not offer actual text sizes (10,11 etc) in the docker, only increase/decrease
29.08.2008-17:46 < seele> neha_p: i'm just not sure if that is the best place for it.  it is a text attribute, not a decoration.  just like text color is an attribute
29.08.2008-17:46 < el_> that's to keep the actual style independent from that tagging
29.08.2008-17:47 < neha_p> seele: are you talking about the background color..i am sorry, i am lost
29.08.2008-17:48 < neha_p> el: the font size is present in the tool options docker but you are right that format docker only allows to increase or decrease size
29.08.2008-17:49 < el_> neha_p: would you provide fixed font sizes or the relative increase/decrease buttons or both? 
29.08.2008-17:49 < neha_p> el: my opinion was to keep the format docker as primary docker and introduce the best features available from tool options into the format
29.08.2008-17:50 < neha_p> because users are much familiar with the terminolofy 'format' rather than the 'tool options'
29.08.2008-17:50 < neha_p> el: I would prefer fixed font sizes
29.08.2008-17:50 < el_> ok, so you have a permanent format docker. i think that makes sense when we get shapes with text, otherwise you wont be able to format the text of multiple shapes properly
29.08.2008-17:51 < el_> neha_p: why so?
29.08.2008-17:51 < neha_p> yes that's true
29.08.2008-17:52 < neha_p> I would prefer fixed font sizes because it would be easier for me to handle the whole document
29.08.2008-17:52 < el_> hm. seele, do you have an opinion on that? 
29.08.2008-17:53 < neha_p> if I had created the document in pieces, it would make more sense for me if I know the font size
29.08.2008-17:53 < el_> neha_p: when you copy/paste?
29.08.2008-17:55 -!- nehap [n=pahwaneh@rm23397.rit.edu] has joined #sou-koffice
29.08.2008-17:55 < nehap> Did I missed on something...my internet connection is giving me a hard time
29.08.2008-17:56 < seele> el_: not sure, because i always assume the style will take care of my fonts for me
29.08.2008-17:56 < seele> and i always make sure the element has the right style so it will look OK on other people's computers
29.08.2008-17:56 < el_> seele, yes, that's what the increase/decrease is meant to do
29.08.2008-17:56 < seele> i think MS Office 2007 uses font + - by default, adjusting the pt level is an advanced option now
29.08.2008-17:57 < el_> instead of changing the font color, you only give a bigger/smaller tag
29.08.2008-17:57 < el_> i actually think it's neat
29.08.2008-17:57 < seele> i'm OK with +/-, if you arent using a style then you treat it like a wysiwyg 
29.08.2008-17:57 < el_> but well, the users have to understand it...
29.08.2008-17:57 < seele> i dont think it will be hard
29.08.2008-17:57 < nehap> that's a good point...i didn't thought about it
29.08.2008-17:57 < seele> infact, i think google docs does it too
29.08.2008-17:58 < seele> maybe we could do a split dropdown
29.08.2008-17:58 < seele> if you click + or - it does one level of that action
29.08.2008-17:58 < seele> but if you click and hold, you can see the font sizes
29.08.2008-17:59 < el_> but it would still set a relative font size
29.08.2008-17:59 < el_> so if 10 is my default and i set it to 12, its 14 in another style that uses 12 as default size
29.08.2008-17:59 -!- neha_p [n=pahwaneh@rm23397.rit.edu] has quit [Read error: 60 (Operation timed out)]
29.08.2008-17:59 < seele> yeah, smallest, small, normal, big, bigger?
29.08.2008-17:59 < seele> maybe with smallest (8pt) to give a sense of size?
29.08.2008-18:00 < el_> yeah. 
29.08.2008-18:01 < el_> but we might need more steps
29.08.2008-18:02 < el_> another design detail is about the color widget
29.08.2008-18:02 < el_> nehap: in the document you write that color opens the color dialog
29.08.2008-18:02 < el_> we might offer a split dropdown here as well with the most common colors
29.08.2008-18:03 < el_> so users won't need to open the dialog every time
29.08.2008-18:04 < nehap> it actually gives a drop down box with the most common colors
29.08.2008-18:04 < el_> really? where is that?
29.08.2008-18:04 < nehap> and then there is a button within the box that gives the way to more colors 
29.08.2008-18:05 < nehap> el: checking...
29.08.2008-18:06 < seele> nehap: is it using the standard kde color chooser widget/
29.08.2008-18:06 < nehap> In the tool options docker, there is color: written 
29.08.2008-18:06 < nehap> and beside it is the text and the background color
29.08.2008-18:07 < el_> nehap: which tool is selected?
29.08.2008-18:07 < nehap> it is actually showing a drop down sign beside its icon
29.08.2008-18:07 < el_> bescause i don't see it
29.08.2008-18:07 < nehap> seele: i am not sure about that
29.08.2008-18:08 < nehap> el: You need to select the docker called 'tool options'
29.08.2008-18:08 < el_> maybe you got a different version?
29.08.2008-18:08 < el_> tool options under style?
29.08.2008-18:08 < nehap> maybe; i can send you the screen shot of it
29.08.2008-18:09 < el_> great, thanks
29.08.2008-18:10 < el_> for bullets: currently, bullet styles are in a combobox
29.08.2008-18:11 < el_> it is really difficult to select a bullet style becuase there is no preview
29.08.2008-18:11 < el_> there should be a quick way to make a default bullet and a default numbered list
29.08.2008-18:12 < el_> nehap: can you create a mockup of a better solution than the combobox?
29.08.2008-18:13 < nehap> yes i will try for it
29.08.2008-18:13 < el_> great
29.08.2008-18:14 < el_> and my last issue is predefined text formats. would you merge character and paragraph styles or provide two lists as currently?
29.08.2008-18:15 < nehap> hmmm...i am not sure about that
29.08.2008-18:15 < el_> you have to leave in 5 minutes, right?
29.08.2008-18:15 < nehap> Yes
29.08.2008-18:16 < el_> i think the styles should be merged. it's too complicated like that
29.08.2008-18:16 < el_> we should ask boud why they did it
29.08.2008-18:16 < nehap> I would definitely try to merge it
29.08.2008-18:16 < nehap> Yes...I agree with you el
29.08.2008-18:17 < nehap> Sure...do you want me to ask boud?
29.08.2008-18:17 < el_> nehap: for the next meeting, can you mock all this up? and please also think about the sequence of options (like seele pointed out in the beginning - maybe you need to group options other than described in the document)
29.08.2008-18:17 < nehap> yes...
29.08.2008-18:17 < el_> yes, please ask him
29.08.2008-18:17 < nehap> ok
29.08.2008-18:18 < el_> nehap: if you think that there are multiple ways to group options, you can create alternatives and we discuss them
29.08.2008-18:18 < el_> no need to do it in axure
29.08.2008-18:18 < nehap> yeah...that sounds like a good idea
29.08.2008-18:18 < nehap> ok el
29.08.2008-18:18 < el_> seele: do you have anything to add?
29.08.2008-18:21 < seele> no, i think mockups are a good idea
29.08.2008-18:22 < seele> i'ts getting hard to visualize some of the details in her documents
29.08.2008-18:22 < seele> (sorry, phone was rining)
29.08.2008-18:23 < el_> shall she create mockups for all dockers or should we first discuss the suggestions in the document?
29.08.2008-18:27 < seele> we can finish discussing the document
29.08.2008-18:27 < seele> since we just did text
29.08.2008-18:28 < seele> gah, the PHONE AGAIN
29.08.2008-18:30 < seele> nehap: is shape collection and shape tools two separate dockers?
29.08.2008-18:31 < seele> hmm.. the other ones seem straight forward.. i think text is complicated because it is very tied in to paragraphs and styles
29.08.2008-18:31 < seele> el_: maybe she is ready to just mock them up?
29.08.2008-18:34 < el_> seele: neha had to leave at 18.20
29.08.2008-18:35 < el_> i don't think the others are so straight forward - for shapes, there should also be options to change the shape color. i think geometry/resizing is not sufficient
29.08.2008-18:42 -!- nehap [n=pahwaneh@rm23397.rit.edu] has quit [Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)]
29.08.2008-18:44 < el_> is the only way to change the color of a shape to select the gradient tool? stroke can be changed by the shape properties docker, but color seems to be the gradient tool.....
29.08.2008-18:44 < seele> yeah, i was going to ask 
29.08.2008-18:44 < seele> gradient by itself isnt a lot but color seems to be implied
29.08.2008-18:44 < el_> once we got the docker contents we really have to work on the tool interaction
29.08.2008-18:44 < seele> or texture too
29.08.2008-18:45 < el_> neha said she is going to continue her work on kword
29.08.2008-18:45 < seele> oh great!
29.08.2008-18:46 < el_> yes :)
29.08.2008-18:49 < el_> gradients can only be applied to shapes, right? why is it a separate tool then and not a shape property?
29.08.2008-18:52 < seele> no, i think they can be applied to pattners and curves too
29.08.2008-18:55 < el_> but patterns are also applied to shapes
29.08.2008-18:56 < el_> and i think when you single click a curve, it should provide the same options as the shape
29.08.2008-18:56 < el_> move/resize/change style
29.08.2008-18:56 < el_> only when you double click the curve should be editable (path tool)
29.08.2008-18:56 < seele> oh. hmm
29.08.2008-18:57 < seele> should the curve be part of shapes then?
29.08.2008-18:57 < seele> same with patterns?
29.08.2008-18:57 < el_> no, i think curve is a tool, but pattern is a property of a shape, a path or a curve
29.08.2008-18:58 < el_> gradient/pattern is more like the background color of an object
29.08.2008-18:59 < el_> and shapes, paths, curves are objects
29.08.2008-18:59 < el_> that's how i understand it here in kword
29.08.2008-18:59 < el_> oh, crashed.... :-/
29.08.2008-19:04 < el_> i'm about to leave... enjoy the weekend!
