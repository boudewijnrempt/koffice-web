      <h2>Why Support KOffice?</h2>
      <p>
      The KOffice team is working very hard to provide you with a free office
      suite for the UNIX operating system. KOffice is available for
      free and will always be available for free -- including each and every
      line of its source code -- for everyone to modify and distribute. If you
      would like to use a free and powerful office suite in the future please
      consider supporting the KOffice project.
      </p>
