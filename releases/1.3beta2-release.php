      <p>The KOffice team is proud to announce the release of KOffice 1.3 beta2.</p> 
      <p>This release is a sequel to the 1st beta in the 1.3 series, bringing
         a lot of bugfixes and a couple of new features (see the complete changelog below).
      </p>

      <p>Note: Kexi isn't part of this version nor will it be in the final
      KOffice 1.3. It is slated for a stand-alone release later this year and
      will re-integrated into KOffice in the next major version.
