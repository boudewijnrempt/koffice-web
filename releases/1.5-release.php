  DATELINE APRIL 11, 2006<br />
  <!-- FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE -->
  EMBARGO - DO NOT PUBLISH
</p>

 <p>
 The KOffice team is proud to announce KOffice version 1.5. With this release,
 KOffice starts its ascent into the office suite hall of fame in the company
 of OpenOffice.org and MS Office.
 </p>

 <h2>Native Support for the OpenDocument File Format</h2>
<p>
 KOffice was the first to support, and now with 1.5 the second office suite to announce full support for OpenDocument as the default file format. It is also the first one not based on the OpenOffice.org code base, which makes ODF into a true industry standard. KOffice 1.5 is therefore the version that lets enterprises and organizations all over the world choose the office suite that fits their needs best.</p>
<p>
 The spread of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">OASIS
 OpenDocument File format (ODF)</a> is widely regarded as one of the most
 important developments in the whole IT industry right now. It will give
 users world-wide the opportunity to control the future of their own
 data and also ensure that all documents can always be read at any
 time in the future.
</p>
<p>
 KOffice 1.5 offers native ODF support for the important productivity applications <a href="http://www.koffice.org/kword/">KWord</a> (.odt), <a href="http://www.koffice.org/kspread/">KSpread</a> (.ods), and <a href="http://www.koffice.org/kpresenter/">KPresenter</a> (.odp).  In addition to that, the supporting applications <a href="http://www.koffice.org/kchart/">KChart</a> (.odc) and <a href="http://www.koffice.org/kformula/">KFormula</a> (.odf) also support ODF, although not yet fully.</p>
<p>
 Great care has been taken to ensure interoperability with other office software that supports OpenDocument, most notably OpenOffice.org.  We acknowledge, however, that the ODF support and interoperability is not yet perfect. We hope to be able to quickly identify and fix the incompatibilities that do exist in the upcoming 1.5.1 and 1.5.2 bugfix releases.
</p>

 <h2>Killer Applications</h2>
 <p>
  KOffice is already the most comprehensive office suite in existence. In addition to the basic productivity applications mentioned above, it also includes a creativity application suite featuring <a href="http://www.koffice.org/krita/">Krita</a>, a paint application with lots of image manipulation features, <a href="http://www.koffice.org/karbon/">Karbon</a>, a vector graphics application, and <a href="http://www.koffice.org/kivio/">Kivio</a>, a Visio&reg; style flowcharting application. Other components are <a href="http://www.koffice.org/kexi/">Kexi</a>, an integrated environment for creating database applications, and <a href="http://www.koffice.org/kplato/">KPlato</a>, a program for project management.</p>

 <p>
 Even as parts of a suite, some of these applications are outstanding in their field:
 </p>

 <ul>
 <li>
  <p>
  <b>Krita</b> is a full-featured pixel-based image application with layer support,
  full colorspace independence and a versatile
  plug-in based architecture. Krita has advanced tremendously since
  the first released version and now sports: L*a*b and CMYK colorspaces, scripting,
  adjustment layers, layer groups and a first preview release of a natural
  media simulation colorspace for watercolors.
  </p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>
  <b>Kexi</b> 1.0 is the much awaited data management application
  that is the KOffice counterpart to MS Access or FileMaker. Kexi integrates
  the data and GUI into one file that can be easily sent over the internet
  as an email attachment.
  </p>
  <p>
  Using Kexi, a new database project can be set up in less than one minute
  as a single efficient file, without the need for administering servers.
  When needed, MySQL or PostgreSQL servers can be used for storage, or
  existing projects can be imported from MySQL or PostgreSQL servers or
  MS Access files. The final version
  focuses on data exchangeability and server support.
  </p>
  <p>
  Kexi is the first KOffice component to be <a href="http://www.kexi.pl/wiki/index.php/Kexi_for_MS_Windows">ported to Windows</a> and is also commercially supported by <a href="http://www.openoffice.com.pl/en/kexi">OpenOffice Polska</a>.
  </p>
 </li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Fast Paced Development</h2>
 <p>
  The KOffice team has been able to keep development speed very high. The reason for this is the code base which is very sound and easy to work with. It also builds on a solid foundation made up of the Qt library and the KDE base libraries.
 </p>
 <p>
  Despite its having more components than any other office suite, things are improving very quickly.  Version 1.5 features OpenDocument as the default file format, introduction of a unified scripting framework, improved accessibility for handicapped users, the first major release of Kexi and a technology preview of KPlato, a new project management application.  You can read more about it in the <a href="/announcements/announce-1.5.php">full announcement</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
  KOffice has doubled the size of its developer base from around 15 at the time of KOffice 1.4 to around 30 at the time of KOffice 1.5. We are at present experiencing a healthy growth in our developer community, which bodes well for the future.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regarding future development, KOffice 2.0 will be released around the turn of the year 2006/2007. It will build on the same platform as KDE 4.0, which means immediate portability to Windows and MacOS X. KOffice 2.0 will also include improved font handling, change management and improved integration.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the development speed of KOffice, we expect most of the components to reach a best-of-breed status in the world of Open Source office programs in 1 to 2 years.
