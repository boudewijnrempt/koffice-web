1. Systems affected:

        KOffice 1.3 up to including KOffice 1.3.5


2. Overview:

        The KOffice PDF Import Filter shares code with xpdf. xpdf contains
        a buffer overflow that can be triggered by a specially crafted
        PDF file.

        The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
        has assigned the name CAN-2005-XXXX to this issue.


3. Impact:

        Remotely supplied pdf files can be used to execute arbitrary
        code on the client machine when the user opens such file in
        KOffice.


4. Solution:

        Source code patches have been made available which fix these
        vulnerabilities. Contact your OS vendor / binary package provider
        for information about how to obtain updated binary packages.


5. Patch:

        Patch for KOffice 1.3.5 is available from 
        ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/security_patches:
