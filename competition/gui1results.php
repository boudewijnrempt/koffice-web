<h3>Competition Results</h3>

<p>The jury has been very pleased to receive a large number of high-quality,
innovative and fun entries. Entries varied from rethinking the entire
work flow for office workers to a careful analysis of the weak points
of the current general practice, with wonderful and weird ideas on the
text-entry process in between. It turns out that it <i>is</i> possible
to find new directions for Office software.</p>

<p>Some general trends were clear across the entries: a palette-based
interface was a recurring theme, for instance. That's something we've
seen before in the Adobe applications or on NeXTStep, but not generally
applied to Office software.  Something to be considered for KOffice 2.0!
Not all suggestions were entirely practical or even feasible, but that
was exactly the intention of this competition: to break through the
familiar mold and get fresh ideas.</p>

<p>The decision was quite hard, but in the end the jury was in complete
agreement:</p>

<p>The winner is <b>Martin Pfeiffer</b>, for his thorough and innovative
rethinking of the entire process of creating and working with documents
and tools. <b>Manik Chand Patnaik</b> deserves an honourable mention as
runner-up for his meticulous analysis of the way office software could
work better. <b>Dennis Pennekamp</b> deserves to be mentioned for his
innovative and fun proposal to use Krita and KPresenter together to
podcast comics -- which was only one of his many really innovative
ideas.</p>

<p>All submitters have reason to be proud of their work and the jury is very
grateful for their submissions. We especially wish to commend those
people whose native language is not English for their courage. They labored under the
additional handicap of a sometimes unfamiliar language and still managed
to present their ideas.</p>

<h4>Entries</h4>

<p>As promised, all entries are available under the GPL. The capsule
reviews below are in many cases not representative of the depth of the ideas
presented in the proposals themselves. Also note that the KOffice developers
have not committed themselves to implementing any of these ideas.</p>

<h5><a href="./gui1results/aiveras_kirejevas.pdf">Aiveras Kirejevas</a></h5>

<p>Aiveras advocates a palette-based interface with some interesting twists. His
very nicely done mockups show the replacement of the "Window" menu by a tabbar,
document versioning and an interface extensible through plugins that
are grouped into task-related collections. Aiveras' ideas have the advantage
of being eminently implementable. SQL for text is an interesting suggestion
for a replacement for the find &amp; replace dialog.</p>

<h5><a href="./gui1results/aron_allen.pdf">Aron Allen</a></h5>

<p>Aron presents an interface that contains a thumbnail of the current page, a
toolbox and a tool area that present different options dependent on the selection
of a main menu item. His proposal thus does away completely with the need for
dropdown menu scanning.</p>

<h5><a href="./gui1results/david_metz.pdf">David Metz</a></h5>

<p>David Metz has two main points: he wants to do away with the need for explicitly
saving documents, and he wants to move all control functionality into floating
palettes. No menus or toolbars anymore! The consequences of this decision have 
been carefully examined by David.</p>

<h5><a href="./gui1results/david_reaves.txt">David Reaves</a></h5>

<p>David did not have time to complete his entry, but mailed us his basic idea:
a toolbar button that would enable the access to toolbars through using the scroll
wheel of the mouse.</p>

<h5><a href="./gui1results/dennis_pennekamp_1.pdf">Dennis Pennekamp -- Getting more out of KOffice 2</a></h5>
<h5><a href="./gui1results/dennis_pennekamp_2.pdf">Dennis Pennekamp -- Krita Podcasting Plug-in</a></h5>
<h5><a href="./gui1results/dennis_pennekamp_3.pdf">Dennis Pennekamp -- Freestyle Art</a></h5>

<p>Dennis' ideas were consistently the most innovative among the entries. Maybe not
always completely practicable, his idea for a new text editing engine is the first
truly original rethink of the text entry process we've ever seen. His Freestyle Art
concept should be very useful in practice, though. Coding it is going to the problem!
</p>

<h5><a href="./gui1results/jeroen_vaes.pdf">Jeroen Vaes</a></h5>

<p>Jeroen's particular idea for the implementation looks very practical and
implementable. There's a shade of Corel Painter palettes here -- his startup
widget is very well thought-out, as are his ideas on adding notes to documents.
</p>

<h5><a href="./gui1results/luc_marschall.pdf">Luc Marschall</a></h5>

<p>Luc went back to the absolute basics: the handling of windows
and tools. Much fundamental thought went into his entry and Luc carefully examined
all possible consequences of his initial ideas.</p>

<h5><a href="./gui1results/manik_chand_patnaik.pdf">Manik Chand Patnaik</a></h5>

<p>Manik Chand Patnaik very carefully examined user interface and usability issues
in KOffice and has come up with very good and detailed proposals for improving
the user interface from the smallest details to the larger workflow and presentation
issues. Especially appreciated were his concerns about security and font technology.</p>

<h5><a href="./gui1results/martin_pfeiffer.pdf">Martin Pfeiffer</a></h5>

<p>Martin Pfeiffer, our winner, has gone back right to the roots of the problem and
has started with the question "what is it we're trying to do, actually". Working from
that principle, he arrives at an interesting, innovative workflow-based solution that
is both ambitious and takes the human factor into account. The idea of "patterns" to
style parts of documents is very interesting. Added to that, there are
a number of larger and smaller suggestions for improvement.</p>

<h5><a href="./gui1results/moritz_zimmermann.pdf">Moritz Zimmermann</a></h5>

<p>Moritz presented his ideas in such beautiful mockups -- although some of the
credit must go to the icon set he used -- that it was hard not to be mesmerized
by them. His interface looks very practicable and implementable. The interface
is proposed to be self-learning. Again, we have Adobe like dockers with a tab
dock.</p>

<h5><a href="./gui1results/nikolai_shapovalov.pdf">Николай Шаповалов</a></h5>

<p>Николай's main goal has been to reduce the amount of pixels occupied by user 
interface control elements and to maximize the amount of space available for the
user's document.

<h5><a href="./gui1results/sandis_neilands.pdf">Sandis Neilands</a></h5>

<p>Sandis' vision is to do away with having a multitude of specialized applications.
Somewhat like Gobe Productive, he wants one application that allows users to
combine different types of data in one document. Then he goes one step further and
wants to make it possible to reflow content into another shape: from book to presentation,
from spreadsheet (cells) to document again. A very innovative idea, this, and 
Sandis earns extra points for actually including engaging use cases.</p>


<h5><a href="./gui1results/sergiy_kudryk.png">Sergiy Kudryk</a></h5>

<p>Sergiy, like Николай, wants to reduce the amount of non-document pixels on screen
as much as possible: he goes further and wants to work in full-screen only, with a
kpdf-like navigation bar to the left, and an optional floating toolbox.</p>

<h5><a href="./gui1results/thomas_zander.pdf">Thomas Zander</a></h5>

<p>Thomas has concentrated on one aspect: collaborative workflow. His proposal is
to use KPlato, the new project planner component in KOffice 1.5 to monitor and enable
the document creation and editing workflow in small groups. A good idea, one that
further demands integration with kde-pim.</p>

<h5><a href="./gui1results/tom_chance.pdf">Tom Chance</a></h5>

<p>Tom Chance concentrates on the creation of documents. His interface reminded us
on the one of hand of latex, and on the other hand of a content management system
like Infrae's Silva. Style and content are to be separated completely in his
proposal.</p>

<h5><a href="./gui1results/will_hardy.pdf">Will Hardy</a></h5>

<p>Will Hardy proposes a "waterfall" model of editing, where content creation
and content editing are separate phases. There are several quite good ideas 
in his submission, one of which is the paragraph property cut-out that "travels"
with the current paragraph. His interface is also a model of clarity and simplicity.</p>
