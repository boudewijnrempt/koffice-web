I had an idea which I never had time to iron out and put formally into a
pdf. Simply It would be to have a button near the top left of the screen
which you could click. Then (the button would remain depressed) you could
use the scroll wheel on your mouse to transition through different toolbars.
It is obvious that not everyone has a mouse with a scroll wheel but this
button would not be required and there should be other ways to add and
remove toolbars from view. I just thought it was an interesting and
innovative way of providing some pizzaz. 

 

Also you should consider the approach adobe uses in its products. Tabbed
toolbars.

 

Be careful about putting too much on either the left or the right side of
the screen because users simply aren't accustomed to it.

 
Thanks for your time,
