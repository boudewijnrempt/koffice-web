KOffice 2.0.0 Released

DATELINE May xx, 2009

The KOffice team is extremely pleased to finally announce version
2.0.0 of KOffice.  This release marks the end of over 3 years of work
to port KOffice to Qt 4 and the KDE 4 libraries and, in some cases,
totally rewrite the engine of the KOffice applications.

Over the last few years, the KOffice team has reworked the framework
into an agile and flexible codebase.  Our intention was to increase
integration between the components of KOffice, decrease duplication of
functionality and ease maintenance and development of new
features. Furthermore, new approaches to UI design and interacting
with the user have been implemented to support the new capabilities.

Target Audience

The goal of this release is to release our first preview of what we
have accomplished.  This released is mainly aimed at developers,
testers and early adopters.  It is not aimed at end users, and we do
not recommend Linux distributions to package it as the default office
suite yet.

KOffice 2.0 will be useful for some users, but since it is the first
release in a long series it is likely to contain bugs and
incompatibilities.  

It is noteworthy that KOffice 2.0 does not have all the features that
KOffice 1.6 had.  These features will return in the upcoming versions
2.1 and 2.2, in most cases better implemented and more efficient.
Also, not applications in KOffice 1.6 made it into 2.0.  The missing
applications will return in 2.1 or possible 2.2.

Components

The release team has decided that the following applications are
mature enough to be part of 2.0:

KWord      - Word processor
KSpread    - Spreadsheet calculator
KPresenter - Presentation manager
KPlato     - Project management software
Karbon     - Vector graphics editor
Krita      - Raster graphics editor

The chart application KChart is available as a shape plugin, which
means that charts are available in all the KOffice applications in an
integrated manner.

The desktop database creator Kexi and the formula shape will be
available in version 2.1. Kivio, the flowchart editor, is currently
without maintainer and it is not certain when or if it will be
released.


Highlights of KOffice 2
-----------------------

KOffice 2 is a much more flexible application suite than KOffice 1
ever was.  The integration between the components is much stronger,
with the revolutionary Flake Shapes as the central concept.  A Flake
Shape can be as simple as a square or a circle or as complex as a
chart or a music score.

With Flake, any KOffice application can handle any shape. For
instance, KWord can embed bitmap graphics, Krita can embed vector
graphics and Karbon can embed charts.  This flexibility does not only
give KOffice unprecedented integration, but also allows new
applications to be created very easily.  Such applications can
e.g. target special user groups like kids or certain professions.


Unified Look and Feel

All the applications of KOffice has a new GUI layout better suited to
todays wider screens.  The GUI consists of a workspace and a sidebar
where tools can dock.  Any tool can be ripped off to create its own
window and later be redocked fo full flexibility.  The users setup
preferences are of course saved and reused the next time that KOffice
is started.

Platform Independence

All of KOffice is available on Linux with KDE or GNOME, Windows and
Macintosh.  Solaris will follow shortly and we expect builds for other
Unix versions to become available soon after the final release.  It is
possible that the release of binaries for Windows and Macintosh will
occur after some time if other packages that KOffice depend on need
more time.

Since KOffice builds on Qt and the KDE libraries, all applications
integrate well with the respective platforms and will take on the
native look and feel.

Native Support for OpenDocument

The OASIS OpenDocument Format (ODF) is the ISO standard for office
document interchange.  ODF has been selected as the national standard
for many countries around the world, and continues to grow stronger
every month.

KOffice uses the OpenDocument Format as its native format. This will
guarantee interoperation with many other Office packages such as
OpenOffice.org and MS Office.  The KOffice team has representatives on
the OASIS technical committee for ODF and has been a strong
participant in the process of shaping ODF since its inception.


Bug Reports and User Feedback

The developers are very interested in user feedback and bug reports.
Please report bugs that you find on the KDE bugzilla <a
href="http://bugs.kde.org">bugs.kde.org</a>.  In particular, the
KOffice Team is interested in bugs in the following areas:

 * OpenDocument support
 * Crashes
 * Errors on non-Unix platforms since most developers run Linux and
   may overlook these.
