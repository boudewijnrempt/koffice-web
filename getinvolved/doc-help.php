	<p>KOffice has developed into a set of well-integrated, and complex set of software.
	Every developer has worked hard to ensure that the user can work effectively.
	</p>

	<p>
	<strong>KOffice needs clear, complete and useful documentation to allow KOffice users to
	get the most out of KOffice.</strong>
	</p>

	<p>
	Documentation will include individual application manuals for each KOffice application
	and some documentation which covers data-sharing and overall use of KOffice.
