    <p>KOffice is a very large project. There are many fields where
    help is needed (all fields, in fact). If you want to contribute
    to KOffice you could:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="doc-help.phtml">write documentation</a></li>

      <li><a href="http://i18n.kde.org">translate KOffice</a></li>

      <li><a href="http://artist.kde.org">draw graphics</a></li>

      <li><a href="http://users.skynet.be/kborrey/klipart/klipart.html">contribute artwork</a></li>

      <li>help programming. This means development work on the main
      applications, new applications, <a
      href="../filters/index.phtml">filters (desperately
      needed!)</a>, plugins and datatools, more functions for
      KSpread, ...</li>

      <li>fix small bugs if you find them and send a patch.</li>

      <li>test KOffice extensively and send descriptive bug reports
      via the "Help, Report Bug" mechanism in the programs.</li>

      <li><a href="../support">donate money or hardware</a>
      Yes, this is needed in free software development, too,
      e.g. for extending the KOffice server.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you want to help the KOffice developers (or even become
    one) please <a href="../contact.phtml#lists">subscribe to the
    koffice-devel mailing list</a> so you know what's needed and we avoid
    duplicating work. Please don't be angry if you don't get
    instant replies - everybody has got a lot to do.</p>
