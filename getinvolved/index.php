    help is needed (all fields, in fact). If you want to contribute
    to KOffice you could:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>help programming. This means development work on the main
      applications, new applications, <a
      href="/developer/filters/index.php">filters (desperately
      needed!)</a>, plugins and datatools, more functions for
      KSpread...</li>

      <li>fix small bugs if you find them and send a patch.
      See also the <a href="/developer/tasks/">Task List</a>.</li>
      
      <!--<li>write documentation. In this case, please
      <a href="mailto:raphael.langerhorst@kdemail.net">contact Raphael Langerhorst, the documentation coordinator for KOffice</a>,
      to discuss with him where to work.
      (<a href="http://i18n.kde.org/doc/index-script.php">See also the documentation writing homepage</a>).
      </li>-->

      <li><a href="http://i18n.kde.org">translate KOffice</a></li>

      <li><a href="http://artist.kde.org">draw graphics</a></li>

      <!-- What is the status of this? -->
      <li><a href="http://users.skynet.be/kborrey/klipart/klipart.html">contribute artwork</a></li>
      
      <li>help maintaining koffice.org. See the <a href="/developer/website/tasks.php">Web Task List</a>.</li>

      <li>test KOffice extensively and send descriptive bug reports
      <a href="http://bugs.kde.org">via the "Help, Report Bug" mechanism</a> in the programs.</li>

      <li><a href="/support/">donate money or hardware</a>
      Yes, this is needed in free software development, too,
      e.g. for extending the KOffice server.</li>
      
    </ul>

    <p>If you want to help the KOffice developers (or even become
    one) please
    <a href="http://www.kde.org/mailinglists/index.php#koffice-devel">subscribe to the koffice-devel mailing list</a>
    (or use <a href="http://www.kde.org/mailinglists/index.php#koffice">the KOffice mailing list</a>)
    so you know what is needed and we avoid duplicating work. Please do not be angry if you do not get
