<h2>Core Technology Highlights</h2>
<h3>Starting up - It's all new</h3>
<p>
As a result of collaboration of usability experts, the KOffice startup dialog has been completely redesigned: it is now much cleaner and as a result is easier to use than ever.

</p>
<h3>OpenDocument Format support</h3>
<p>
OASIS OpenDocument is the default native format for all major KOffice applications. This is a major step towards interoperability of major office suites on the basis of an open industry standard. Numerous office suites also use this format: OpenOffice.org is just one example of many. Supporting the OASIS OpenDocument thus contributes to the open and free global standard for office files.
</p>
<h3>Enhanced Accessibility</h3>
<p>
KWord, KSpread, and KPresenter include some enhancements for near blind users 
to have the text spoken of widgets under the mouse pointer and/or widgets 
that have the focus. It also adds a <strong>Speak Text</strong> option in the context menu 
of the KWord Document Structure Area, which is useful for listening to a 
document.<br />

</p>
<p>
In addition, all KOffice programs are enhanced for mouseless operation with customisable keyboard shortcuts. For instance, by default you can press Alt+F8 to activate an assistant that allows you to easily place focus on any part of the application, hassle-free.<br />

<p>
For additional information on accessibility features in KOffice, please see the <em>"For Users With Disabilities"</em> sections of the KWord, KSpread, or KPresenter handbooks.
</p>
<h3>Scripting Support</h3>
<p>
KOffice's unified scripting approach, Kross, provides you with an easy way to optimise applications by writing Python and Ruby scripts for KOffice applications.
