 <h2>Diving into KOffice</h2>

 <p>
 With recent releases KOffice has established its status as the most comprehensive office suite in existence.
 No other office suite provides as many integrated and diverse components as KOffice. At the same time, KOffice
 requires only little memory and provides good performance, making it suitable even for old hardware and avoiding
 the need for expensive upgrades.
 </p>
 <p>
 The list of stunning improvements for the 1.5 release is simply huge, and all of them were implemented
 just within a couple of months. KOffice is picking up momentum, quite a lot as well. This tour gives a
 comprehensive overview of recent highlights. Make yourself comfortable, and enjoy the KOffice Tour.

 <!-- the following is by no means complete, just a skeleton, will be improved later -->

 <h2>Core Technology Highlights</h2>

 <h3>Starting up - It's all new</h3>

 <p>Usability experts worked together on a complete new design of the KOffice startup dialog. It is now
 easier to use, more powerful and flexible. And above all, it's nice as well:</p>

 <h3>Native OASIS OpenDocument Format support</h3>

 <p>Finally, OASIS OpenDocument is the default native format for all major KOffice applications.
 This is a major step towards interoperability of major office suites on the basis of an industry
 standard. OpenOffice.org also uses OpenDocument as native file format, other office suites support
 it as well. Supporting the OASIS OpenDocument thus contributes to the global industry standard
 for office standards.</p>

 <h3>Enhanced Accessibility</h3>

 <p>All major KOffice applications have improved accessibility features, including text to speech.</p>

 <h3>Unified Scripting Support</h3>

 <p>KROSS now allows scripting of some KOffice applications using Python and Ruby.</p>


 <h2>KWord</h2>

 <h2>KSpread</h2>

 <h2>KPresenter</h2>

 <h2>Kexi</h2>

 <h2>Kivio</h2>

 <h2>Karbon14</h2>

 <h2>Krita</h2>

 <h2>KPlato</h2>

 <h2>KChart</h2>

 <p>
 KChart is the charting component of KOffice. It can be embedded into almost 
 any other KOffice application, such as KWord or KSpread. It supports 8 
 different types of charts, among them bar, line, area, pie, ring and polar 
 charts.  Almost every aspect of the chart can be customized after the chart 
 is created, such as colors, fonts and placement of different entities like 
 the legend.
