    <p>There are some jobs in KPresenter, which I can't do (because
    I'm not very good in making attractive graphics). If you are
    interested in doing such a job, please contact me, or better
    contact developers by <a
    href="mailto:koffice@kde.org">mail</a>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Creating templates</li>

      <li>Creating autoforms</li>
