<strong>Tegel Airport to Motel:</strong> From the airport, take the number 128 bus to the U Osloer Str underground station (a map of where the airport's buses are located can be found <a href="http://www.berlin-airport.de/DE/ReisendeUndBesucher/AnUndAbreise/AnfahrtBusUndBahn/TXL/OeffentlicheTXL.html">here</a>). Here you take the U8 to Hermannstr. These trains arrive every five to ten minutes, and the journey to the U Moritzplatz station from there is approximately fifteen minutes. From there, it is roughly a fifty metre walk to the Motel One Berlin-Mitte.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bahnhof Zoo to Motel:</strong> From the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Zoologischer_Garten">Bahnhof Zoo</a> railway station you need to take the subground (S-Bahn) S5 with to Mahlsdorf; the journey from here to S+U Alexanderplatz is approximately ten minutes. There, you have to switch to the U8 underground to Hermannstr. Please note that the Alexanderplatz-station is rather large and to switch to the U8 you may need to walk a few metres and follow those markers that points to the U8. Once you are in the U8, it takes around 10 minutes again till you arrive at the U Moritzplatz station. From there it's approximately a fifty metre walk to the Motel One Berlin-Mitte.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Hauptbahnhof to Motel: </strong> Beside the railway station Bahnhof Zoo, there is a railway station named Hauptbahnhof (or just "Berlin, Hbf" as a shorthand). To get to the motel from this station is just the same as the one described above for the Bahnhof Zoo. So, at the Hauptbahnhof, board the S5 to Mahlsdorf and switch at the Alexanderplatz-station to the U8 bound for Hermannstr to reach the Moritzplatz-station.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Schoenefeld Airport to Motel:</strong> From the terminal, walk to the bus station for the bus X7. Take this bus to the U Rudow. You then enter the underground (which is denoted by a blue sign with a white U on it) and take the U7 going to Rathaus Spandau, and leave at Hermannplatz. Here you change to the U8 heading to Wittenau, getting off at Moritzplatz. From here, it is roughly a fifter metre walk to the Motel One Berlin-Mitte.
