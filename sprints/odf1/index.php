<p>
From <strong>Saturday the 12th of May 2007 until Sunday the 13th</strong>, KOffice is organising an ODF "hackathon" weekend to be held at <strong>Berlin's KDAB offices</strong>.
</p>
<p>This meeting is kindly sponsored by KDAB which provides its office rooms in Berlin and as you know, even geeks need to eat, so they also provide food and drinks in abundance. <a href="http://ev.kde.org">KDE eV</a> is sponsoring accomodations and travel.<p/>

<h3>What is the purpose of this weekend?</h3>
<p>
With the release of KOffice 2.0 (and KDE4.0!) drawing closer every day, KOffice wishes to integrate itself further with the OpenDocument Format (ODF) standard. As a result, a meeting has been organised for representatives from each KOffice application in order to further merge KOffice with the ODF format and create a bigger and better standard for the office suite. It is hoped that this meeting will shape and define the future of ODF within KOffice, and KDE in general.
