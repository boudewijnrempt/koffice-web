<p> From <strong>Saturday the 27th of October 2007 until
Sunday the 28th</strong>, KOffice is organising a KOffice 2.0 Spit'n'Polish
"hackathon" weekend to be held at <strong>Berlin's KDAB offices</strong>.
</p>

<p>This meeting is kindly sponsored by <a
href="http://www.klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se/">KDAB</a> which
provides its office rooms in Berlin and as you know, even geeks
need to eat, so they also provide food and drinks in abundance. <a

travel.<p/>

<h3>What is the purpose of this weekend?</h3>

<p>After the success of the ODF hack sprint, the KOffice project members are
invited for another intensive weekend of discussions and hacking, this time
geared towards getting the common user interface elements polished to a high
shine. We'll also be discussing matters relating to our release process and
release schedule.</p>
