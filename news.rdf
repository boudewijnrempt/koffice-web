<title>The First release of KOffice 2.0 alpha for Windows</title>
<date>May 19th, 2008</date>
<fullstory>
The First release of KOffice 2.0 alpha for Windows is now available for testing. This is
one of the most visible steps to bring the KOffice suite to Windows users. The KOffice package can be 
installed using the <a href="http://winkde.org/pub/kde/ports/win32/installer/">KDE Windows Installer</a>.
There are still some rough edges in the packaging, since you will have to copy the <i>dll</i> files
from kde4/lib to kdek/bin directories which contains the executables. More information about installing KDE applications
on Windows can be found in <a href="http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/KDE_on_Windows/Installation">KDE on Windows/Installation</a> Techbase article.

<title>OpenDocument is Now a Real ISO Standard</title>
<date>December 01, 2006</date>
<fullstory>
Yesterday ISO, the International Standards Organization, finally made
the OpenDocument Format (ODF) specification into a real ISO standard
by pushing the specification into stage 60/60.  This means that every
government on earth could -- and indeed should -- specify ODF as the
preferred format for storing office files.  This is relevant for
KOffice since KOffice is the first office suite that used ODF as the
default file format and is now only superseded by OpenOffice.org in
the support of it. For more details, see the

<title>KOffice gets major boost for the (near) blind</title>
<date>27th November, 2005</date>
<fullstory>
KOffice is a part of KDE which means that assistive technologies already available in KDE will be available in KOffice.  This was not yet the case for so called Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies. Until today!<br />
The next KOffice release will allow near blind users to have the text spoken of widgets under the mouse pointer and/or widgets that have the focus. It also adds a "Speak Text" option in the context menu of the KWord Document Structure Area, which is useful for speaking a document.<br />

<title>KOffice in Open Document Fellowship</title>
<date>12th October, 2005</date>
<fullstory>
    "Open Document for an Open Future" is <a href="http://opendocumentfellowship.org">the Open Document Fellowship</a> motto. The Open Document Fellowship which was launched on Monday has been formed to promote the <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/office/faq.php">OpenDocument format</a> as well as the applications natively supporting it. Among the applications listed is of course <a href="http://opendocumentfellowship.org/Applications/KOffice">KOffice</a>. The formation of the Open Document Fellowship also underlines the war of words that has broken out over this issue between Sun and the open source community on one hand and Microsoft on the other. <br />
    <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/office/">OASIS</a>, the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards, the group behind the OpenDocument standard has submitted the document format to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), a move that could make open-source desktop applications more attractive to governments.

<title>Koffice, OpenDocument and Kexi in the news this past month</title>

    Following the <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050923142231938">announce by The Commonwealth of Massachusetts</a> to use only documents in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">OpenDocument format</a>, Microsoft manager Alan Yates tried to <a href="http://www.mass.gov/Aitd/docs/policies_standards/etrm3dot5/responses/microsoft.pdf">dismiss the use of OpenDocument</a> as "illegal". KOffice new Marketing Coordinator Inge Wallin replied with an <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1127515635/">Open Letter to Alan Yates</a> and <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/09/25/1713249&amp;tid=121&amp;tid=218&amp;tid=219">Slashdot</a> as well as <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050925165302314">Groklaw</a> promptly joined the debate by relaying the Dot article.<br />
    And yesterday, at the OpenOffice Conference, Tim Bray delivered a <a href="http://ooocon-ljudmila.kiberpipa.org/media/">keynote speech</a> about the  importance of open formats.<br />
    The key point is the strong OpenDocument support by KOffice products which makes KOffice one of the more powerful free office suites.<br /> <br />
    <a href="http://www.koffice.org/kexi/">Kexi</a> wins some points against OpenOffice Base in the <a href="http://applications.linux.com/article.pl?sid=05/09/08/1411250&amp;tid=73">Building databases with Kexi and OpenOffice.org 2 Base</a> article, especially regarding the speed.
