<title>KOffice in Open Document Fellowship</title>
<date>12th October, 2005</date>
<fullstory>
    "Open Document for an Open Future" is <a href="http://opendocumentfellowship.org">the Open Document Fellowship</a> motto. The Open Document Fellowship which was launched on Monday has been formed to promote the <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/office/faq.php">OpenDocument format</a> as well as the applications natively supporting it. Among the applications listed is of course <a href="http://opendocumentfellowship.org/Applications/KOffice">KOffice</a>. The formation of the Open Document Fellowship also underlines the war of words that has broken out over this issue between Sun and the open source community on one hand and Microsoft on the other. <br />
    <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/office/">OASIS</a>, the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards, the group behind the OpenDocument standard has submitted the document format to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), a move that could make open-source desktop applications more attractive to governments.

<title>Koffice, OpenDocument and Kexi in the news this past month</title>
<date>30th September, 2005</date>
<fullstory>
    Following the <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050923142231938">announce by The Commonwealth of Massachusetts</a> to use only documents in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">OpenDocument format</a>, Microsoft manager Alan Yates tried to <a href="http://www.mass.gov/Aitd/docs/policies_standards/etrm3dot5/responses/microsoft.pdf">dismiss the use of OpenDocument</a> as "illegal". KOffice new Marketing Coordinator Inge Wallin replied with an <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1127515635/">Open Letter to Alan Yates</a> and <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/09/25/1713249&tid=121&tid=218&tid=219">Slashdot</a> as well as <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20050925165302314">Groklaw</a> promptly joined the debate by relaying the Dot article.<br />
    And yesterday, at the OpenOffice Conference, Tim Bray delivered a <a href="http://ooocon-ljudmila.kiberpipa.org/media/">keynote speech</a> about the  importance of open formats.<br />
    The key point is the strong OpenDocument support by KOffice products which makes KOffice one of the more powerful free office suites.<br /> <br />
    <a href="http://www.koffice.org/kexi/">Kexi</a> wins some points against OpenOffice Base in the <a href="http://applications.linux.com/article.pl?sid=05/09/08/1411250&tid=73">Building databases with Kexi and OpenOffice.org 2 Base</a> article, especially regarding the speed. Find out more by reading the article and discover that Kexi indeed has the potential to be Microsoft Access rival!
