<p>Krita is a generic paint application for a diverse audience with a
desire to do image processing or painting.  Krita has come to a point
where the future of the application is based on choices of how to
present certain features, as well as which features to work on in the
first place.  Krita developers recognize that just adding features
without a general design will not lead to the most satisfactory user
experience.</p>

<p>Based on the concepts from Alan Cooper we create a small number of
personas which we feel are the target users of Krita.  This means that
all work that is seen in the user interface should be created first
and foremost with one of these personas in mind.  If we can not find a
use case where one of our personas actually finds the feature practical
and fullfilling a goal then the feature does not belong in Krita.</p>

<p><b>Arthur</b> 19, England.<br>
Amateur photographer</p>
<p>Arthur is a young man from England who has invested in a good
digital camera which he uses to take good scenic photos which he takes
home looks through and maybe only saves 2 out of 10, because the rest
is not good enough. Arthur feels he has a creative senese for taking good
photos and uses Krita to do some filtering and general touchup.</p>

<p>Arthur could just as well have used digikam or other similar
application but likes the abillity to do just a little more if he
feels like it, which he sometimes do. Arthur puts thumbnails up on his
webpages and sells prints to interested buyers. Mostly for fun since
he rarely sells more than a dozen a year. Arthur does know that
colormanagement is important for making good prints, and is able to
see when the colors look like he want it.</p>

<p>Arthur owns a normal LCD monitor and hasn't done any profiling of it

<p><b>Ben</b> 35, New York.<br>
Professional photo retoucher</p>

<p>Ben is a 35 year old man who does freelance photo retouching for
ads in womens style magazines. Ben is based in New York. Photographers
come in with their shots and he uses Krita to smooth the skin of
models, removing imperfections, make theirs eyes more white, etc. Even
changes their body contour or otherwise alter the image, to get just
the image that will sell the product.</p>

<p>WYSIWYG is very important for him so he has a very expensive
monitor that he gets profiled every month. Ben also owns a tablet which
he uses because using a mouse for those fine details is just not good
enoug for him. The office he is working in has been specialy designed
with respect to lightning to produce the most realistic viewing
experience as possible.</p>

<p>Ben has taken a 4 year education in graphical design and worked
with graphics for almost 12 years, mostly with Photoshop, but was
convinced of the power of Krita through a friend.</p>

<p><b>Claire</b> 27, San Francisco<br>
Original artwork creator</p>

<p>Claire is a 27 year old woman from San Francisco who has a job
producing original artwork. Claire is employed by a special effects movie
studio where she draws artistic backgrounds, textures for 3d models
and almost everything in between. Claire has been very skilled at
painting/drawing since as long as she can remember, but have not had
any formal graphical education</p>

<p>The movie studio uses Linux for most of it's 3d rendring as has
chosen to also use Linux and KDE for the rest of their production
line. Claire doesn't mind much as she hadn't really used a computer
before taking this job 5 years ago. Claire does like using computers now
though.</p>

<p>Claire has a big widescreen monitor and a tablet to draw with. The
company require all drawings to be in very high definition and that
the result looks great on big movie screens.</p>
